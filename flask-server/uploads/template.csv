Executive Summary 
The Criminal Justice Services office recommends that the Judicial Council receive the Recidivism 
Reduction Fund Court Grant Program: Final  Report, 2019, and direct the Administrative Director to 
submit this annual report to the Joint Legislative Budget Committee and the Department of Finance 
as mandated by the Budget Act of 2015 (Assem. Bill 93; Stats. 2015, ch. 10). The report documents the Recidivism Reduction Fund court grant program, describes grant-related activities of the Judicial Council and the grantees, and addresses the effectiveness of the programs based on established outcome measures and the impact of the monies appropriated to enhance public safety and improve 
offender outcomes.
 
Recommendation  
Staff to the Judicial Council’s  Criminal Justice Services office recommend that the Judicial 
Council:  
1.Receive the attached Recidivism Reduction Fund Court Grant Program: Final  Report, 2019, that
documents the outcomes of the Recidivism Reduction Fund court grant ; and 2 2. Direct the Administrative Director to submit this report to the Joint Legislative Budget 
Committee and the Department of Finance as mandated by the Budget Act of 2015 (Assem. 
Bill 93 ; Stats. 2015, ch.  10).  
Relevant Previous Council Action  
At its meeting on November 30, 2018, the Judicial Council received the Recidivism Reduction Fund 
Court Grant Program, Annual Report 2018. The Judicial Council directed the Administrative 
Director to submit the annual report to the Joint Legislative Budget Committee ( JLBC ) and 
Department of Finance ( DOF ) as mandated by the Budget Acts of 2014 and 2015 (Sen. Bills 852 
and 69, respectively). The Judicial Council authorized staff to continue to work with the courts to 
complete  data analysis  on the programs as directed by the Legislature.  
Analysis/ Rationale  
As part of the Budget Act of 2014, the Legislature directed the Judicial Council to develop and 
administer a competitive grant program for trial courts that incorporates practices known to reduce adult offender recidivism. The council is required to submit  a final  report four years after 
the grants are awarded to the JLBC and the DOF as mandated by the Budget Act of 2015. The  
Recidivism Reduction Fund Court Grant Program: Fina l Report , 2019, reviews the 
establishment of the Recidivism Reduction Fund ( RRF ) court grant program, describes grant -
related activities of the Judicial Council and the grantees, and provides information that 
addresses 
the effectiveness of the programs based on established outcome measures and the impact of the 
monies  appropriated to enhance public safety and improve offender outcomes.  
The Judicial Council’s Recidivism Reduction Fund court grant program is an ambitious project 
that provided funding for 39 pretrial and collaborative court programs, encouraging collaboration among the gr antee courts and justice system partners. Approximately 96 percent of the $15.43 
million  awarded to the courts was fully expended by the end of the program period, April 30, 
2018. The implementation of the RRF program provides critical lessons for the loca l 
jurisdictions and the state in grant management, outcome measurement, and training and technical assistance for criminal justice programs.  
Policy implications  
The implementation of the RRF program provides critical lessons for the local jurisdictions and the 
state in grant management, outcome measurement, and training and technical assistance for criminal 
justice programs. CJS staff have been working with Leadership Support Services staff overseeing the 
Court Innovations Grant Program to share best practi ces and lessons learned in grant administration 
and evaluation. F indings from RRF pretrial grantees are also be ing used to inform the 
implementation activities following the passage of AB 74 (Budget Act of 2019), which provided  
funding for pretrial pilot p rograms.

 Recidivism Reduction Fund Court Gr ant Program: Final Report 2019  1 Executive Summary  
In fiscal year 2014–15, the Legislature allocated $16.3 million from the Recidivism Reduction 
Fund (RRF) to a competitive  grant program designed f or courts to use for programs and practices 
known to reduce offender recidivism and enhance public safety . The grant program was 
administered by the Judicial Council with funding appropriated as part of the Budget Act of 2014 
(Sen. Bill 852;  Stats . 2014, ch. 25)  and the Budget Act of 2015 ( Assem. Bill 93 ; Stats. 2015, 
ch. 10). Overall, 39 local projects were fu nded —20  collaborative court programs and 11 pretrial 
programs. In addition, 8 small grants were made for courts to conduct twelve -month training and 
technical assistance projects for their staff and local partners.  
The Budget Acts  directed the Judicial Council  to establish performance -based outcome measures  
and report annually to the Joint Legislative Budget Committee and the Department of Finance . 
This final report addresses the effectiveness of the grantee programs based on established 
outcome measures an d the impact of the monies  appropriated to enhance public safety and 
improve offender outcomes. 
Program Evaluation 
Performance -based outcome measures were developed for both types of program s in partnership 
with grantee courts and with guidance from subject matter experts in the fields of collaborative 
justice and pretrial programs. This report describes final data and outcomes based on program data collected for the 31 pretrial and collaborat ive court program s over all three years of the 
grant.  
Collaborative Courts Findings  
Collaborative court programs served a high volume of participants during the grant period, retained most program participants, and had low reported recidivism rates. Eleven different types of collaborative courts participated in the grant program, including adult drug courts, veterans treatment courts, and mental health courts, and those programs received 4,000 new entries during the grant period. Retention rates were strong , with approximately 80 percent  of participants 
either graduating from the program or continuing to receive services and comply with program requirements one year after entry. In -program recidivism rates were low: approximately 7  
percent  of participants re ceived new charges as a result of an arrest, and only around half of 
those resulted in a conviction. Only 66 participants out of a total of more than 4,000 new entries were discharged from collaborative court programs because of a new misdemeanor or felony  
charge.  
Pretrial Program Findings  
Eleven pretrial program grantees conducted nearly 50,000 pretrial risk assessments during the grant period. The programs assessed detainees’ risk of new crime or failure to appear (FTA) during the pretrial period and provided this information to judicial officers for consideration in Recidivism Reduction Fund Court Gr ant Program: Final Report 2019  2 making pretrial release determinations at arraignment. Ten of the pretrial programs implemented 
monitoring programs, and released 7,000 defendants to pretrial monitoring; other pretrial defend ants remained eligible for release on their own recognizance or with a secured bond. The 
reported FTA and new arrest rates for defendants released under the RRF monitoring programs were consistent with the defendants’ assessed risk level.  
Supplemental Pret rial Program Evaluation  
In four of the pretrial programs, individual defendant data was matched with local justice system partner and California Department of Justice data, which allowed for a more comprehensive analysis of pretrial outcomes. This more intensive analysis of data for the four pretrial programs found the following:  
• Risk assessment tools worked well to differentiate defendants by risk level —those 
assessed as low risk had the lowest rate of pretrial failure, and those assessed as high risk had the highest rate of pretrial failure.  
• Focusing on releasing more defendants according to risk level could lead to more optimal release practices for each county depending on local policy preferences and risk tolerance.  
• Analysis of the data suggests that pr etrial programs could be used to safely release more 
low- and moderate -risk defendants pretrial without increasing the level of risk to public 
safety or failures to appear in court.  
• Further study is needed on effective supervision and monitoring practices of released 
individuals —effective monitoring practices, such as court date reminders, might further 
maximize release without increasing pretrial failure rates.  
Conclusion  
The success of collaborative court and pretrial programs supported by the Recidivism Reduction Fund grant program could be replicated and expanded in order to maximize safer and more just 
outcomes. Results from the evaluation of these programs support the case for ongoing and sustained funding for both collaborative court and pretrial prog rams. The evaluation of the RRF 
collaborative court programs is consistent with over 20 years of collaborative court research that  
shows that these courts are effective at reducing offender recidivism. The findings of this evaluation and new research on pr etrial programs demonstrate that risk -informed decision-
making can  increase release without jeopardizing public safety and appearance in court.  
The recently enacted 2019 –20 state budget included funding for pretrial pilot courts to increase 
safe and effici ent pretrial release. The new pretrial pilot program requires pilot courts to assess 
nearly all individuals booked into county jails prior to arraignment, and to gather data on all individuals released pretrial. The findings from this RRF evaluation can pr ovide a road  map for 
the new pilot courts to implement policies and procedures to maximize pretrial release while maintaining public safety.  
 
 Recidivism Reduction Fund Court Gr ant Program: Final Report 2019  3 The Judicial Council’s  Recidivism Reduction Fund Court 
Grant Program  
Background  
For over two decades, California’s prison system faced many challenges with overcrowding and 
lawsuits related to the provision of health and mental health services in prison. The prison population increased from approximately 60,000 inmates in 1986 to an a ll-time high of 173,479 
in 2006. In 2011, the United States  Supreme Court upheld a lower court ruling requiring the 
California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to reduce the population in its institutions to 137.5 percent of the system’s design capacity .
1 
As part of the effort to reduce the prison population and recidivism , the Budget Act of 2014 
established  the R ecidivism R eduction F und (RRF) . In the Budget Act of 2014 (Sen. Bill 852;  
Stats . 2014, ch. 25)  and the Budget Act of 2015 ( Assem. Bill 93;  Stats. 2015, ch. 10) , the 
Legislature allocated a total of $16.3 million from the RRF for a competitive  grant program to be 
developed and administered  by the Judicial Council of California  (Judicial Council). The funds 
were designated for courts to us e in the administration and operation of programs and practices 
known to reduce offender recidivism and enhance public safety, including  pretrial  programs,  
collaborative c ourts that serve moderate-  and high -risk adult offenders (hereafter referred to as 
collaborative courts), and  court use of validated risk and needs assessment information.2 
The legislation directed the Judicial Council to administer the program, establish performance -
based outcome measures , and report annually to the Joint Legislative Budget Committee ( JLBC ) 
and the Department of Finance (DOF) . The legislation also directed the Judicial Council to 
provide a final report to the JLBC and DOF four years after the grants were awarded to address the effectiveness of the programs based on the established outcome measures and the impact of the monies  appropriated pursuant to this act to enhance public safety and improve offender 
outcomes. 
As charged by SB  852, the Judicial Council provided a preliminary report to the JLBC and the 
DOF in March 2015, and annual report s in 2016 through 2018. The  annual reports described the 
establishment of the RRF  court grant program , funding allocations , local program 
implementation activities , and procedures for establishing data collection and validation 
methodologies . All RRF annual reports can be accessed on the “ Recidivism Reduction Fund 
Court Grant Program ” page  of the California Courts  website .

Judicial Council’s approach to the  evaluation of the program and includes  a final assessment of 
the effectiveness of  both pretrial and collaborative court program types. The report also includes 
a final section describing the methodology and findings of a more in- depth study of a subsample 
of the pretrial programs.  
Grant Awards  
The Judicial Council  developed and released an RRF request for proposals (RFP)  in October 
2014. Grant funds were intended to benefit  as many courts as possible , and the RFP process was 
structured to encourage statewide geographic and program diversity with funding priority given to planning and implementation proposals for new programs. In 2015, the  Judicial Council 
awarded $15,314,146 in funding to 32 applicant courts  (12 pretrial release programs and 20 
collaborative court programs)
4 in two funding phases. Initial grant a wards range d from 
approximately $130,000 to $600,000. In 2016, t he Judicial Council  authorized development of  a 
third phase of  the RRF program to provide smaller grants  to courts for training and technical 
assistance related to programs and practices known to reduce offender recidivism. Eight superior courts received training or t echnical assistance grants totaling approximately $120,000, with 
awards ranging  from approximately $8,000 to $20,000. 
Because initial program start- up activities lasted longer than anticipated for most projects, 
spending in the first year was slow. With  Judicial Council authoriz ation  to work with grantee 
courts to most effectively utilize  RRF funds , staff  conduct ed two separate reallocation processes  
in 2016 and 2017. Funds left over by fiscal year-end were offered to courts that demonstrated the 
ability  to spend them, and contracts were amended accordingly.  For a summary of all final  RRF 
Collaborative Court s and Pretrial Program grant  allocations , see Attachment A . In addition, a  
map illustrating all county awards is provided as Attachment B . 
In total, by the conclusion of the funding period on  April 30, 2018, courts and their local partners 
had expended more than 96 percent  of the funding allocated to their programs. While 
establishing partnerships, documenting agreements , and hiring staff delayed proje ct spending 
early on , implementation activities and associated expenditures increased steadily each year 
through the end of project . 
Program Monitoring 
The full RRF program implementation period spanned April 1, 2015, through April 30, 2018, although some projects ended June 30, 2017. For a summary of RRF Collaborative Court s and 
Pretrial Program project implementation time  frames, see Attachment C . Judicial Council staff 
conducted a variety of monitoring and technical assistance  tasks  including site v isits, fiscal 
monitoring, and training and technical assistance activities.  
                                                 
4 The Superior Court of San Luis Obispo County was awarded funding for a pretrial program but opted out of 
further participation in March 2016.  Recidivism Reduction Fund Court Gr ant Program: Final Report 2019  5 Data Collection 
RRF grantee courts were required to submit quarterly data on their programs that included both 
program summary information as well as individual -level data on parti cipant characteristics and 
outcomes. Data were submitted through a secure site and cleaned by Judicial Council  staff.  
Additional information on the data collection process can be found in the RRF Annual Report  
2017.5 
                                                 
5 See www.courts.ca.gov/RecidivismReduction.htm . Recidivism Reduction Fund Court Gr ant Program: Final Report 2019  6 RRF Program Overview and Evaluation  
The Budget Act of 2014 required the Judicial Council  to establish performance -based outcome 
measures , collect and analy ze data from grantees,  and submit a report that addresses the 
effectiveness of the programs based on the reports of the established outcome measures . Judicial 
Council staff, in partnership with the grantee courts, identified  performance measures 
appropriate for each program based on existing research and expert recommendations in the 
fields  of collaborative justice and pretrial  programs . Judic ial Council staff reviewed the national 
literature and expert recommendations and engaged in an iterative process with the courts to 
identify data elements that were feasible for local courts to collect  in order to report identified 
performance measures . 
Performance measures tracked across all grantee courts are responsive to the legislative directive 
to address the effectiveness of the programs and the impact of the monies  appropriated but  were 
not intended to be considered a comprehensive program evaluati on. T he Judicial Council 
recognized  the need for a more  comprehensive  analysis of the RRF  pretrial program s and 
conduct ed an in-depth analys is on a subset of the programs .6 
This section provides an overview of both program types, the evaluation approaches, and 
program findings.  
Collaborative Courts  Overview  
Adult criminal collaborative justice court programs ( sometimes referred to as problem -solving 
courts ) combine intensive judicial supervision and collaboration among justice system partners 
with rehabilitation services to reduce recidivism and improve outcomes for moderate and high -
risk offenders with significant treatment needs. Although program models differ among court types and local jurisdictions, adult criminal collaborative courts are generally led by a judge and include an interdisciplinary team consisting of a defense attorney, a prosecutor, a representative from probation or parole, and treatment  staff and/or case managers or other stakeholders specific 
to the particular type of court. Most of these cases are postadjudication models in which participants plead guilty to their charges and, in lieu of incarceration, are placed in the collaborative court under community supervision.  
Collaborative court participants are typically assessed for substance use disorders, mental health issues, and other treatment needs  as well as their risk to public safety . Community supervision 
and treatment plans are created based on the information obtained from these assessments. Participants attend regularly scheduled court sessions, usually one to four times a month, to discuss their adherence to supervision, treatment plans , and other program requirements. 
Graduated sanctions (e.g., admonishments, increased frequency of court sessions, and brief jail 
                                                 
6 Research on pretrial programs was prioritized because California and several other states are considering or 
implementing statewide pretrial reform efforts that could benefit from the data gathered in the study. In addition to 
the mandated outcome measu res, this report concludes with a more in -depth analysis in the Supplemental Pretrial 
Program Evaluation (see pages 2 1–33). Recidivism Reduction Fund Court Gr ant Program: Final Report 2019  7 sanctions) are used to respond to noncompliant behaviors, and incentives (e.g., verbal praise, 
reduced frequency of court hearings, and transportation or food vouchers) a re used to reward 
prosocial behaviors and encourage participants’ progress. Participation in collaborative court programs is typically required for 12 to 18 months at which point successful participants can graduate.  
There are a variety of collaborative co urts operating in California including drug courts, mental 
health courts, co- occurring disorder courts for individuals exhibiting both substance use 
disorders and mental illness, veterans treatment courts, driving under the i nfluence (DUI) courts, 
and dome stic violence courts. Although these courts differ in their target populations and some 
practices, the courts funded through the RRF were all required to follow the key p rinciples of 
collaborative c ourts
7 and to target moderate-  to high- risk participants. Grantee courts used their 
funding in a variety of ways to support their collaborative court programs. While most jurisdictions supported court staff and treatment or supervision activities in one specific collaborative court, some grantees chose to use the ir funds for services or activities that served a 
variety of collaborative courts in one jurisdiction. For example, the Superior Court s of 
San Francisco and Santa Clara Counties created program s to provide supportive housing to 
participants in several of the collaborative courts. A summary of all collaborative court programs funded can be found in Attachment D.  
Collaborative Court Evaluation Approach  
Drug courts are the longest -running and most prolific type of collaborative court and have been 
heavily researched for more than two decades. The large body of research indicates that these programs are effective and result in reduced recidivism among participants .
8 Although the body 
of research is  less extensive for other collaborative courts , studies on m ental health c ourts ,9 DUI 
courts ,10 and r eentry courts11 have shown these court models also to be effective. Other newly

 Recidivism Reduction Fund Court Gr ant Program: Final Report 2019  8 emerging collaborative court programs , including veterans t reatment c ourts, have yet to generate 
a comprehensive body of research due to their nascency and still others, such as domestic 
violence c ourts , have mixed evaluation results. T he court  models that  have less voluminous 
bodies of research  share similar objectives and practi ces to  the proven models . Because these 
courts lack national standards for performance metrics, consensus among court staff  and experts 
was that the broad performance metrics used for drug courts would be the most appropriate 
measures applicable to the  collaborative courts  funded under this grant . 
The National Drug Court Institute, with support from the U.S.  Department of Justice’s Bureau of 
Justice Assistance, convened a group of researchers and other national subject -matter experts in 
drug courts to devel op common performance metrics for the field. In June 2006, this National 
Research Advisory Committee (NRAC) identified four recommended metrics12 considered high 
priority  including sobriety, in- program recidivism, retention, and service utilization . Judicia l 
Council staff worked with grantee courts to prioritize which performance measures were most 
essential and feasible to collect and to create standard data definitions. Through this process two 
of the measures were identified a s top priorities: i n-program recidivism ( defined as a re- arrest 
that resulted in program termination or the filing of a new criminal charge while in the program) 
and retention (defined as  successfully graduating or remaining in the program for at least 12 
months ). Descriptive statistics about the collaborative court programs and their outcomes appear 
below. 
Collaborative Court Programs Findings  
Summary of Findings  
• Eleven  types of collaborative  court program s were supported through the grant including 
adult drug courts, veterans treatme nt courts, mental health courts , and reentry courts.  
• Participating  collaborative court  program s served a high volume of participants —over 
4,000 new entries during the grant period.  
• Retention rates were strong , indicating approximately 80  percent  of participants either 
had graduated or continued to receive services and compl y with program  requirements  
one year after entry . 
• In-program recidivism rates were low, with only 7 .2 percent  of participants receiving  new 
charges as a result of an arrest , and a pproximately half of those resulting in a conviction. 
Of 1,683 total exits from the program, successful and unsuccessful , courts reported  only 
66 participants ( 4 percent ) discharged because of  a new misdemeanor or  felony charge.13

Collaborative Courts  Descriptive Statistics  
The RRF program funded 20 collaborative courts. Grantees reported a total of 4,079 entries to 
the 20 court programs from July 1, 2015, through March 31, 2018. These came from a total of 5,542 referrals to the court programs. By the end of the grant program data collection period, a total of 1,683 individuals had exited their court  program s, either succes sfully or unsuccessfully 
(see Attachment E , Table 1) , and 2,396 were still participating in the programs  when data 
collection terminated.  
                                                 
recidivism information in their own county, and they do not always receive the information for participants who 
may have been arrested in other jurisd ictions.  Recidivism Reduction Fund Court Gr ant Program: Final Report 2019  10 Table 1.  Collaborative Courts Quarters Reported—Referrals, Entries, and Exits  
 
 
Grant -funded program entr y demographi cs varied by type of court and location, but on the 
whole , of the participants whose information was reported , 78 percent  were male and 21  percent  
female; 42  percent  were white, 36 percent  Latino, 13 percent  black, and 7 percent  other 
race/ethnicities; and  18 percent  were age s 18–25, 37 percent  ages 26–35, 22 percent  ages 36–45, 
14 percent  ages 46–55, and 6 percent  over age 55. The average age of all participants was 35.9. 
(Attachment E , Tables 2 –4.) 
Recidivism Reduction Fund Court Gr ant Program: Final Report 2019  11 Retention Rates  
Program retention outcomes were measured by looking at only those program participants who 
entered their programs during the period July 31, 2015, through March 31, 2017, to ensure the outcome data encompassed a full year following program entry. Participa nts were considered 
retained if one year after their entry dates they were either still participating in the program or had graduated from the program. One year was chosen based on NRAC recommendations and is a common collaborative court program length.  
The overall retention rate for this cohort was approximately 80 percent  (Attachment E , Table 5 ). 
At the end of the data -gathering period (March 31, 2018), of the 4,079 individuals who had 
entered these programs beginning July 1, 2015, 2,396 (59 percent ) were  reported as still enrolled 
and 784 (19 percent ) were reported as having graduated successfully from the program 
(Attachment E , Table  6). 
In-Program Recidivism  
Two separate measures were used to identify in -program recidivism: the  rates at which program 
entrants were charged with or convicted of new misdemeanor or felony offenses while 
participating in grant -funded programs , and the number of participants who  were terminated 
from the program due to new misdemeanor or felony charges  (Attachment E, Table 7).
14 Only 
1.8 percent  overall were reported convicted of a new felony offense, with an additional 2.1 
percent  convicted of  a new misdemeanor  offense . Not counting  those with convictions , 1.7 
percent  of program participants were report ed as  charged  with  a new felony  offense ; an 
additional  1.6 percent  were charged with a new misdemeanor  offense . Only 53 individuals 
(3 percent ) had been discharged from their program for new felony charges and 13 (1 percent ) 
had been discharged from their program for new misdemeanor charges during that same time.15 
Pretrial Programs Overview  
Pretrial programs have three primary functions that include (1) assessing defendant risk of failure to appear for court hearings and risk of committing a new crime if re leased during the pretrial 
phase of a case; (2) communicating information about these risks to the court for consideration in pretrial detention/release decisions; and (3) providing monitor ed release options  to the court  for 
defendants who might otherwise be detained  during the pretrial phase of a case.  
Pretrial programs gather relevant information and use a variety of tools, including validated 
pretrial risk assessment instruments , to assess defendant risk of failure to appear for court 
hearings and risk o f committing a new crime . This r isk information  is communicated to the court 
and allows for  a continuum of pretrial monitoring  options, with intensity of monitoring 
conditions  matched to risk level . Pretrial monitoring conditions  are designed to protect public 
                                                 
14 These measures are not mutually exclusive—participants may be, but are not necessarily, counted both in new 
offenses and in terminations.  
15 Recidivism was tracked by collaborative court program staff and only includes cases that occurred in that  
jurisdiction while the participant was enrolled in the program.  Recidivism Reduction Fund Court Gr ant Program: Final Report 2019  12 safety and help en sure that released defendants return to court . Risk -based recommendations for 
monitoring conditions  aim to avoid the disadvantages of over -monitoring low -risk defendants, 
and at the same time to conserve resources for more intensive monitoring  of high -risk caseloads.  
Pretrial programs may incorporate other important program components including automated 
reminders of court dates, designated prosecutors to review new arrests before initial appearance in court for bail setting , defense attorney representation at bail hearings, needs assessment for 
defendants on monitored release, periodic check -ins with pretrial release officers , and more 
intensive forms of monitoring such as substance abuse testing and electronic monitoring . Pretrial 
program courts used their funding in a variety of ways, from conducting pretrial risk assessments to supervision and monitoring ( Attachment F). 
Pretrial Program Evaluation Approach 
Similar to  the evaluation approach for collaborative courts, Judicial Council staff reviewed 
existing research and recommendations of national subject -matter experts when identifying the 
needed performance measures  for pretrial programs . Although the  diversity of pr etrial programs 
has hindered a national consensus such as exists around drug courts , some experts in the field 
have identified  recommended data elements to collect that can be used to measure program  
performance.
16 Judicial Council staff identif ied data elements to be collected by each court and 
worked with grantee courts to develop the list of required data and data definitions that were feasible to collect.  
One of the significant challenges in collecting data from the pretrial counties related to the need for comprehensive data from the jails on individuals who were booked but were not part of the RRF -supported pretrial program. Most of the courts funded through the project focused 
resources not only on conducting risk assessments, but also on enhancing monitoring and services for pretrial program participants. These courts focused their funding and their data collection efforts mainly on the people who  were monitored and therefore could be more easily 
tracked. Data on defendant s who did not receive services  through the pretrial program would 
have allow ed for the creation of a comparison group to isolate program effects ; however, many 
courts did not have resources, expertise, or the partnerships in place to gather data on individuals who were not monitored th rough the program  and therefore only provide d data on a limited 
number of defendants . Figure  1 depicts  the points in the pretrial system for which RRF pretrial 
program data are availabl e. Because of these data limitations, Judicial Council staff developed a 
more comprehensive research approach for a sample of the pretrial counties  to complement the 
performance measures used for all 11 pretrial programs . Details on that more comprehensive 
study appear below the 11 -county findings.  
                                                 
16 In 2011, the National Institute of Corrections published a comprehensive list of recommended data elements and 
performance metrics for pretrial programs; see National Institute of Correctio ns, Measuring What Matters: Outcome 
and Performance Measures for the Pretrial Services Field  (Aug. 2011), https://nicic.gov/measuring- what -matters-

Recidivism Reduction Fund Court Gr ant Program: Final Report 2019  14 Pretrial Programs Findings  
Summary of Findings  
• All 11 grantee counties successfully implemented programs to assess de tainees ’ risk of 
new crime or failure to appear during the pretrial period and provide d this information to 
judges  for consideration in making pretrial release determinations . 
• 49,607 pretrial risk assessments were conducted during the grant period.  
• Ten counties successfully implemented pretrial monitoring programs, and a total of 7,405 
defen dants were released from jail to pretrial monitoring during the grant period. 
• FTA and new arrest rates overall were consistent with assessed risk level ; however , data 
quality was inconsistent and reported numbers are likely an undercount . 
Pretrial Programs Descriptive Statistics  
All 11 counties receiving grants for pretrial programs conducted assessments of individuals’ 
risks of failure during the pretrial period (Table 2 ).17 These assessments were administered by 
the county p robation department, s heriff’s office, or grantee s uperior court itself. Overall, a total 
of nearly 50,000 pretrial risk assessments were conducted in these 11 counties across the quarterly grant periods for which data were reported to the J udicial C ouncil . 
  
                                                 
17 The numbers of assessments in Table 2 are based on quarterly reports from each county. The Supplemental 
Pretrial Program Evaluation (see pages 2 1–33) is limited to 10 quarters of assessments and then further limited to 
those assessments that could be cross -verified with local jail booking data, that matched assessment eligibility 
requirements as described by each county, and that contained completed disposition data. As a result, the total 
number of assessments is lower in the Supplemental Pretrial Program Evaluation than that reported in Table  2. Recidivism Reduction Fund Court Gr ant Program: Final Report 2019  15 Table 2. Pretrial Program Re cipients and Number  of Risk Assessments Conducted  
 
 
Pretrial program  demographics varied by location, but overall , of the assessed individuals  whose 
information w as reported , 79 percent  were male and 21 percent  female;18 36 percent  were white, 
48 percent  Latino, 16 percent  black, and 6 percent  other race/ethnicities ;19 and 29 percent  were 
ages 18–25, 35 percent  ages 26–35, 19 percent  ages 36–45, 12 percent  ages 46–55, and 5 percent  
over age 55.20 The average age of all assessed individuals  was 33.9. (Attachment G , Tables 7–9.)  
The distribution of assessed risk levels varied by county  (Table 3) . Across all eleven  counties, 21 
percent  of participants were assessed as low risk, 26 percent  moderate  risk, 24 percent  high risk, 
and 28 percent  unknown ( the assessed risk level was missing from the collected data ). Of those 
with a known risk level, the distribution was 30 percent  low risk, 36 percent  medium risk, and 34 
percent  high risk.21 Variations in local data collection practices may make certain risk levels less 
                                                 
18 The share of missing gender data ranges from 0 percent to 50 percent. Across all counties the overall rate of 
missing gender data was 11 percent.  
19 The share of missing race/ethnicity data ranged from 2 percent to 54 percent. Across all counties the overall rate 
of missing race/ethnicity data was 11 percent.  
20 The share of missing age data ranged from 0 percent to 65 percent. Across all counties the overall rate of missing 
age data was 22 percent.  
21 Yuba County used the ORAS risk assessment in combination with other criteria to generate release 
recommendations rather than using low -, moderate - and high- risk groups based exclusively on the ORAS score. 
The recommendations were “Prearraignment OR release with no conditions,” “Prearraignment OR release with 
conditions,” “at arraignment OR release with conditions,” and “Detention.” Throughout this report “Prearraignment 
OR release with no conditions” was reported as low risk, “Prearraignment OR release with conditions” was reported 
as moderate risk, and “at arraignment OR release with conditions” and “Detention” were classified together as high 
risk. As a result of their classification method their risk distribution differs from the other counties’. Upon 
 
Recidivism Reduction Fund Court Gr ant Program: Final Report 2019  16 likely to be recorded in the collected data, so overall risk distribution across all assessments 
conducted may differ. For example, conversations with two pretrial programs revealed that many 
defendants who were assessed as low  risk were released o n OR without monitoring and were not 
reported  in their low -risk assessment  numbers  (Figure 1, box es 14 and  17). 
The risk assessment tools used by all 11 of the Pretrial Program counties provide a risk score that combines risk of new criminal activity during the pretrial period with risk of failure to appear in court as required. Thus, it is not possible to determine whether the risk scores of defendants assessed by the Pretrial Program counties indicate risk to public safety as distinguished from risk of failure to appear.  
Table 3. Assessed Risk Levels of All Reported Assessments 
 
Monitored Pretrial Release  
In addition to providing risk information to judges, t en grantee counties also provided additional 
pretrial release options to judges by implementing  a monitored release program using the grant 
funding .22 Release to pretrial monitoring was  determined at least in part by the recommendations 
of the assessments that were conducted . In total, grantees reported 7,405 releases to monitored 
pretrial release (Table 4) . Counties varied in their definitions of pretrial monitoring, with some 
only including individuals who received active monitoring and som e including individuals 
whose conditions involved only  minimal c ontact . Individuals not counted as released to pretrial 
monitoring may have been released on their own recognizance, bailed out, or remained in jail.  
                                                 
Judicial Council request, Yuba provided the risk distribution based on the ORAS score alone. The ORAS risk score 
distribution was low (0 –2), 16 percent; moderate (3 –5), 56 percent; and high (6+), 27 percent.  
22 Alameda County did not have a supervised pretrial release program during the data reporting period.  
Recidivism Reduction Fund Court Gr ant Program: Final Report 2019  17 Table 4. RRF Volume of Releases to Pretrial Monitoring  
 
 
Pretrial monitoring program demographics general ly resembled those of all the individuals 
assessed  pretrial , but slightly favored older, female , and white defendants . Overall , of the 
monitored individuals whose information was reported, 76 percent  were male and 24 percent  
female;23 39 percent  were white, 43 percent  Latino, 11 percent  black, and 7 percent  other 
race/ethnicities ;24 and 34 percent  were age s 18–25, 33 percent  ages 26–35, 18  percent  ages 36–
45, 10 percent  ages 46–55, and 4 percent  over age 55.25 The average age of all pretrial monitored 
individuals was 32.4. (Attachment G , Tables 10–12 .) 
The risk -level distribution for individuals on pretrial monitoring  differs from the overall 
distribution of assessed risk. Across the ten counties with pretrial monitoring, the risk 
distribution of individuals released to monitoring was 30 percent  low risk, 24 percent  moderate  
risk, 13 percent  high risk, and 33 percent  unknown risk level  (Table 5) . 
                                                 
23 The share of missing gender data across counties ranged from 15 percent to 76 percent. Across all counties just 
over one -quarter of the data were missin g data on gender.  
24 The share of missing race/ethnicity data across counties ranged from 2 percent to 76 percent. Across all counties 
28 percent of the race/ethnicity data were missing.  
25 One county reported no age data; the missing data rate for the remaining counties ranged from 1 percent to 25 
percent. Across all counties roughly one -third of age data was missing.

Failure -to-Appear Rates  for Individuals on Monitored Pretrial Release  
Participating counties tracked f ailure s to appear in court as required  (FTA s) for individuals  
released to pretrial monitoring . Counties varied in their capacity to accurately track FTAs, and in 
some cases reported numbers may be a significant undercount. Across the ten counties, 
individuals on pretrial monitoring had an overall repo rted FTA rate of 12 percent . 
Reported FTA rates overall were consistent with  assessed risk level —across the ten counties, 
reported FTA rates were 11 percent  for individuals assessed as low risk, 15  percent  for moderate 
risk, and 20 percent  for high risk.  Results were varied at the individual -county level  (Table 6) .

New Arrest Rates for Individuals on Monitored Pretrial Release  
In addition to FTAs, pretrial grantee counties also reported new arrests of monitored individuals 
while on pretrial monitor ed release. The reported new arrests may be an undercount, especially 
in cases of out -of-county new arrests and in counties where inter -agency data sharing  is not well-
established. Across the ten counties, the overall reported new arrest rate for individuals on 
monitored pretrial release was 4 percent . 
Reported new arrest rates overall were also consistent with assessed risk level —across the ten 
counties, re ported new arrest rates were 3 percent  for individuals assessed as low risk, 6 percent  
for moderate risk, and 8 percent  for high risk  (Table 7) . Results were varied at the individual -
county level, and data quality issues are a major concern .

Recidivism Reduction Fund Court Gr ant Program: Final Report 2019  21 Supplemental Pretrial Program Evaluation  
Due to  the pretrial programs ’ limited data collection , reliable conclusions could not be drawn 
about FTA and new crime outcomes. T he Judicial Council therefore solicited voluntary 
supplemental data from the courts and  jails  in four counties , and from  the C aliforn ia Department 
of Justice  (DOJ) . By collecting data from multiple sources, the Judicial Council was able to track 
FTA and ne w arrest outcomes for a larger population of pretrial arrestees, including those not 
released to pretrial monitoring. FTA and new crime outcomes were also more accurately 
accounted for by measuring them directly from court and DOJ records rather than relyi ng on 
pretrial program tracking efforts. This extensive data set of individual -level data across agencies 
allowed for more comprehensive analyses of participant outcomes.  
Supplemental Pretrial Program Evaluation Approach  
Judicial Council staff reviewed exi sting research and recommendations of national subject -
matter experts to identify appropriate supplemental data elements and analytical approaches. One of the key goals of the supplementary evaluation was to examine the rates of FTA and new crime during the pretrial period and determine whether the pretrial risk assessment tools successfully differentiated defendants by risk level  for these two outcomes . Furthermore, the analyses aimed 
to shed light on whether  pretrial release decision -making could be improved by using  the risk 
scores  of assessed defendants to (1) increase pretrial success levels at current rates of release, or 
(2) increase the number of defendants released under a pretrial program while maintaining current levels of pretrial success. The evaluation also demonstrates the variation in local practices and outcomes across counties.  
Summary of Findings  
• Risk assessment tools work well to differentiate defendants by risk level so that those assessed a s low risk have the lowest rate of pretrial failure, and those assessed as high 
risk have the highest rate of pretrial failure.  
• A majority of assessed individuals released pretrial, whether to a pretrial program or on 
bail, return to court as required and do not commit a new offense during the pretrial period. 
• The pretrial pilot programs were limited in scope and have ample room for expansion. 
• Focusing on releasing more defendants according to risk level could lead to more optimal release practices for each  county depending on the county’s  policy preferences and risk 
tolerance. For example, releasing more defendants according to risk level could increase release rates with no increase in pretrial failure, or alternatively could reduce pretrial failure rates while maintaining current release rates.  
This analysis is divided into three parts. The first section provides  a brief description of data 
sources and of the participating counties, including their jail population characteristics, the risk Recidivism Reduction Fund Court Gr ant Program: Final Report 2019  22 assessment tools they used, and the eligibility requirements for their pretrial program s. The 
section then addresses the question of whether pretrial risk assessment scores accurately predict 
new criminal activity in the pretrial period and court appearance outcomes.  
The analysis demonstrates that risk assessments tools are effective in assess ing the risk level s of 
pretrial defendants with respect to the likelihood of committing new criminal activity during the pretrial period or failing to appear in court as required. Eac h of the risk assessment tools used in 
the four pilot counties works  well to differentiate defendants by risk level; that is, the defendants 
assessed as low risk proved to be the least likely to recidivate or fail to return to court as required, those asse ssed as high risk were most likely to recidivate or fail to appear in court , and 
those assessed as medium risk fell somewhere in the middle of the low - and high- risk categories.  
The second section  of the report presents data on pretrial program releases  in the context of 
overall jail bookings. The section also includes a description of pretrial release rates by risk  
level. The findings raise a significant policy consideration: the scope of each of these pilot programs was small and the release rates, even f or low -risk defendants, were low relative to the 
overall number of jail bookings in each county.  
The fi nal section uses a constructed  risk tool to examine the question of whether it would be 
possible to maintain current rates of pretrial failure  while releasing more defendants based on 
their risk. Alternatively, the analysis examines whether it would be possible to lower the rate of new criminal activity while keeping release rates at their current level. The hypotheticals  
presented suggest that for the pretrial pilot counties, releasing more defendants according to risk level, resulting in the release of more low - and medium -risk individuals , could increase release 
rates with no increase in pretrial failure . Alternatively, maintaining current rates of release while 
increasing the percentage of released defendants who are low and medium risk could result in lower recidivism rates. Although these results are based on analysis of data for four counties and thus are not generalizable to the stat e as a whole, they do provide an indication of how pretrial 
release based on risk level could lead to more optimal release practices for each county.  
Data  
For the evaluation presented below, Judicial Council staff  examined the universe of those booked 
into jail and released pretrial in four counties for the period July 1, 2015, through December 31, 2018. In addition to the quarterly RRF data extracts provided by all the RRF pretrial pilot counties, four pilot counties also provided jail and court data extracts. T he DOJ provided data on 
arrests that resulted in new criminal filings in the pretrial period.
26 After the data extracts were 
collected from each agency, they were standardized and linked to provide a comprehensive 
                                                 
26 Data from RRF quarterly extracts included information on risk -assessmen t dates, scores, and recommendation for 
release to a pretrial program. County sheriffs’ data included information on arrest dates, charges, booking and 
release types, and dates for those booked into local county jails. County superior court data extracts i ncluded 
information on pretrial disposition dates and failures to appear in court. The DOJ data included information on 
criminal history, rearrests in the pretrial period, and rearrests that resulted in new court filings. The DOJ data include 
out-of-county  criminal activity.  
 Recidivism Reduction Fund Court Gr ant Program: Final Report 2019  23 universe of bookings, assessments, releases , and pretrial outcomes.27 Data range from the 
beginning of the pretrial grant period (July 1, 2015) to the final date for which the J udicial 
Council received complete data from each of the four counties (December 31, 2018). 
County Booking Demographics  
While not intended to represent California in its entirety, the four counties included in this 
analysis range in size, as indicated by their jail population s, and are drawn from distinct 
geographic regions of the state. Table 8 shows that the racial/ethnic  distributions in jail bookings 
varied widely ( black, 4–35  percent ; Hispanic, 20– 77 percent ; and white, 16 –39 percent ), while 
the gender breakdown ( female, 19–23 percent ; male, 77–81 percent )28 and median age (32 –33) 
were similar across the four pilot counties.29 
Table 8. Demographic Summary of Jail Bookings by County 
 
Risk Assessment Tools and Program Eligibility  
Three pretrial risk assessment tools were used across the four counties. County  1 and County  3 
used the  Virginia Pretrial Risk Assessment Ins trument (VPRAI) , County  2 used the  Correctional 
Assessment and Intervention System (CAIS), and County  4 used the  Ohio Risk Assessment 
System —Pretrial Assessment Tool (ORAS -PAT).  
Each county’s program varied with respect to eligibility criteria. For example, the programs in County  1 and County  3 focused primarily on felony bookings. County  1 limited assessment to 
felony bookings without a bench warrant or supervision violation, and County  3 limited 
assessment to nonviolent, non- serious, non- sexual felony bookings without a bench warrant or 
                                                 
27 Records were linked using exact matching on unique personal identifiers and court ID numbers.  
28 Nonbinary, other, and unknown genders represented less than 0.1 percent of the bookings.  
29 Examination of race/ethnic and gender bias is b eyond the scope of this study. The Budget Act of 2019 (AB  74) 
includes funding for pretrial programs and mandates the collection of data for the purpose of studying race/ethnic 
and gender bias.  
Recidivism Reduction Fund Court Gr ant Program: Final Report 2019  24 supervision violation. In contrast, assessments in County  2 and County  4 included felony and 
misdemeanor bookings. County  2 risk assessed those b ooked on nonviolent, non- serious, 
non-sexual felonies and all misdemeanor bookings without a bench warrant or supervision 
violation. County  4 assessed felony and misdemeanor bookings without a bench warrant or 
supervision. 
Risk Assessment Accuracy  
To provi de context for the discussion of risk assessment accuracy, it is  important to note that the 
majority of assessed individuals released pretrial, whether to a pretrial program or on bail, return 
to court as required and do not commit a new offense during the  pretrial period. Overall, among 
assessed and released individuals in the four counties , 82 percent  received no new criminal 
filings during the pretrial period , and 64 percent  made their  required court appearances .30 Given 
that even those who are assessed as high risk do not have high levels of pretrial failure, t he task 
of risk assessment is to accurately differentiate those individuals mo re likely to have pretrial 
success from those mo re likely to  have pretrial failure.  
Tool accuracy is fundamental to the  success of a pretrial release program. Accurate risk 
assessment information can provide judges an additional source of information to make better 
detention and supervision decisions and to maximize the pretrial liberty of defendants while preserving publi c safety. When low -risk defendants are detained , resources must be used for 
incarceration and defendants’ lives may be disrupted without the benefit of increased public safety. Conversely, releasing high- risk people, especially those at high risk of commit ting serious 
crimes, is a threat to public safety. As a result, the more accurate a pretrial tool, the greater the potential benefits if the tool results are followed in the form of lower detention rates and/or reductions in pretrial criminal activity.
31 
The risk assessments tools worked well to differentiate defendants by risk level; lower risk levels 
corresponded with better pretrial outcomes and higher risk levels corresponded with worse pretrial outcomes. Whether data are aggregated across counties or an alyzed separately, higher 
risk levels resulted  in higher pretrial failure rates. Using data aggregated across the four pilot 
counties, Figure 2 and Table 9  show  filings for new criminal activity and court appearance 
outcomes by risk level. The two primary outcomes, arrest resulting in a new filing and FTA, demonstrate the rise in failure rates as risk scores  increase from low to high. New filings for low - 
medium -, and high -risk defendants are 11  percent , 17 percent , and 26 percent , respectively. 
                                                 
30 See Table 9 for FTA and new filing rate for low, medium, and  high assessed -risk levels. Overall failure rates were 
calculated also including those assessed with an unknown risk level.  Results are nearly identical whether the 
“unknown” group is included or not.

More advanced statistical analyses also support these findings.33 Across all four counties, 
differences between low -, medium -, and high -risk defendants are statistically significant and 
higher risk scores are associated with higher pretrial failure rates.  The only outcome for which no 
significant differences were found was new filings for a violent offense. New violent criminal 
activity is rare during the pretrial period , making it a more difficult outcome to predict.34,35 
Tool -Specific Evaluation  
In addition to the combined analysis shown in Table 9, each of the pretrial risk assessment tools used by the counties was also analyzed separately.
36 The findings from this portion of the 
analysis are consistent with the combined analysis and show that a higher risk scor e predicted a 
higher, statistically significant difference in pretrial failure rates.  
Although newer risk assessment tools use separate measures for each outcome of interest, both VPRAI and ORAS were designed to predict composite pretrial failure, meaning the combined risk of a FTA or  a new filing. The CAIS tool was initially designed to measure postconviction 
failure ; however , it was used in the pretrial context in County  2. For each risk tool, a higher risk 
score predicted a higher, statistically signific ant difference in rate of pretrial failure.

33 For regression results, see Attachment H, Section 1, Tables 1.1 –1.4. 
34 A “violent” offense was defined according to the PSA (Public Safet y Assessment) Violent Offense List for 
California; see www.psapretrial.org/implementation/guides/measuring- risk/guide -to-the-psa-violent- offense -list. 
35 Unlike the VPRAI and ORAS, newer risk assessment tools are designed to predict violent recidivism. Although 
not originally designed for the pretrial context, the CAIS was effective at predicting violent recidivism for high -risk 
defendants. (Attachment H, Section 1, Table 1.4.)  
36 See Attachment H, Section 1, Tables 1.1 –1.4, for a county -by-county analysis.  
37 In order to measure tool accuracy based on the outcome the tool was designed to measure, composite pretrial 
failure was used as the outcome for both VPRAI and ORAS. For consistency, composite pretrial failure was also 
used for the CAIS analysis. See Attac hment H, Section 2, Area Under the Curve (AUC) . 
 
Recidivism Reduction Fund Court Gr ant Program: Final Report 2019  27 Additionally, each tool differentiated low -, medium -, and high -risk scores with roughly the same 
degree of accuracy.38 
Scope of Pretrial Programs  
The four pretrial programs studied here were limited in scope and, as a result, there is ample 
room for pretrial program expansion. Under the RRF grant contract obligations, courts were required to use funds for programs and practices known to reduce recidivism and enhance public safety, but programs had broad discretion in their choice and application of pretrial risk assessment tools and in the scale of their programs. The observed impact on overall jail releases as described below would likely have been larger if the programs  had assessed every pretrial -
eligible individual booked into county jail.
39 
A moderate number of total bookings40 were “potentially eligible ” for consideration for pretrial 
release under the program  (73.9 percent , 63.7 percent , 50.6 percent , and 63.6 percent  of total 
bookings in County  1, County  2, County  3, and County  4, respectively ). “Potentially eligible” 
represents the subset of total bookings that excludes those defendants who  are ineligible by law 
for pretrial release. Those excluded as ineligible for pretrial release comprise those booked on federal charges, out -of-county holds, commitment bookings, supervision violations only, and 
detention only bookings . However, based on each program’s parameters, a  smaller  subset of total 
bookings was deemed “program eligible,” or eligible for pretrial program consideration for 
release based on the criteria for that particular county  (26.6 percent , 60.2 percent , 14.0 percent , 
and 36.4 percent  of total bookings in County  1, County  2, County  3, and County  4, respectively ). 
Based again on the specific parameters of each program, an  even smaller subset of defendants 
was assessed by pretrial services. With the exception of County  2, which included most 
“potentially eligible” defendants as “program eligible,” and then conducted assessments on nearly half of those, a relatively small share of “potentially eligible ” bookings resulted in 
assessments (7. 0 percent , 46.8 percent , 6.0 percent , and 5.6 percent  of total bookings in 
County  1, County  2, Count y 3, and County  4, respectively). Similarly, only a small portion of 
“potentially eligible ” bookings resulted in release to a pretrial program
41 (2.6 percent , 31.2 
                                                 
38 See Attachment H, Section 2, Area Under the Curve (AUC) . AUC scores were 0.61 for the VPRAI, 0.60 for the 
CAIS, and 0.62 for the ORAS  using this data (Table 2.1) . Past studies have demonstrated similar AUC scores for 
pretrial risk assessment tools: M.  J. E. Danner, M.  VanNostrand , and  L. M. Spruance , Race and Gender Neutral 
Pretrial Risk Assessment, Release Recommendations, and Supervision: VPRAI and PRAXIS Revised (Luminosity , 
Inc., Nov.  2019) . www.dcjs.virginia.gov/sites/dcjs.virginia.gov/files/publications/correctio ns/race -and-gender -
neutral -pretrial -risk-assessment -release -recommendations -and-supervision.pdf ; C. Cirina -Chiu et al. , Validation of 
the Imperial County Sheriff’s Office Pretrial Assessment Instrument (San Diego State Univ., 2017).  
39 County  2 had the highest assessment rate. It was the only county in which the sheriff’s department was 
responsible for assessments.  
40 Total bookings include every separate instance in which a person is booked into jail in each county.  
41 Many defendants released to a pretrial p rogram, especially those assessed at low risk, may not have monitoring or 
conditions associated with their release. These releases are considered “pretrial program releases” because they were 
released after assessment in accordance with the county’s pretri al service policy.  Recidivism Reduction Fund Court Gr ant Program: Final Report 2019  28 percent , 1.7 percent , and 2.6 percent  of potentially eligible bookings , respectively). Again, 
County  2, which risk assessed a far higher percentage of defendants, also released a significantly 
higher percentage of assessed defendants.  Of those defendants who were assessed, a moderate 
number were released to RRF monitoring pro grams (38  percent , 67 percent , 27 percent , and 45 
percent  of total assessed in County  1, County  2, County  3, and County  4, respectively).  
Except in County  2, these release rates reflect the fact that  the restrictive eligibility criteria for 
each pilot prog ram limited  the share of defendants actually assessed. For example, the  steep 
drop- off observed between the “potentially e ligible” and “program e ligible” for County  1 and 
County  3 was  in large part because both counties limited assessments to those booked on felony 
charges. In contrast, County  2 and County  4 show a smaller drop- off because their pilot 
programs assessed those booked on both felonies and misdemeanors.  
Of the  “program e ligible” bookings in each county, the share assessed ranged from a low of 9.7 
percent  in County  4 to a high of 48.6 percent  in County  2. This is partially explained by the fact 
that many bookings result in a bail or other release type before an assessment can be conducted.  
Table 10 shows that, except for those defendants booked in County  2, almost a third of the 
program -eligible population (28–32 percent ) bails out before pretrial services ha s time to conduct 
a risk assessment. Including other preassessment release types such as cite -and-release and 
capacity release,42 these data show that both program scope and existing options for pretrial 
release help explain why only a portion of those eligible for assessment are actually assessed and 
ultimately released to a pretrial pilot program.43 
                                                 
42 In Table 10, “bail” refers to release after  payment  of cash bail or posting of bond. “ RRF ” refers to release under 
each county’s specific pretrial program conditions.  
“Detained ” refers to those booked who are  not released  pretrial;  generally these defendants are released on time 
served.  
“Cite/Rel ” refers to releases for misdemeanor charges governed by  Penal Code sections 853.6 and 1270.  Under most 
circumstances, law enforcement has the authority to release a misdemeanor arrestee in  the field with a citation  that 
includes a written promise to appear in court . However, citations cannot be issued for offenses involving domestic 
violence or abuse (unless the officer determines there is not a reasonable likelihood that the offense will continue). 
This analysis does not include data on field cite and releases.  Nothing in the law prevents an officer from booking 
the arrestee. The booking officer, under most circumstances, also has the discretion to cite and release a 
misdemeanor arrestee af ter booking.  In this report , “cite and release”  always refers to a release after jail booking.  
“OR” refers to own recognizance release pretrial by a judge. Penal Code sections 1318 –1319.5 and 1270 govern 
release on own recognizance. OR release does not req uire payment of bail, but may include other conditions.  
“Other” refers to a release due to case dismissal, capacity releases due to federal mandates, and other miscellaneous release types.  
43 County  4 is notable for booking and releasing many of those arres ted on misdemeanor offenses who are cited in 
the field in other counties. This explains the 35 percent “Cite/Rel” not assessed.  Recidivism Reduction Fund Court Gr ant Program: Final Report 2019  29 Table 10. Assessment and Release/Detention S tatus of Pretrial Program -Eligible 
Defendants  
 
 Release Rates by Risk Level  
The limited scope of the RRF pretrial pilot programs indicates that, with the exception of 
County  2, there is room for broadening the share of defendants who are eligible for pret rial 
program assessment. Release rates by risk assessment level, Table 11, show the potential for expansion as well. Although release rates to a pretrial program decrease as risk  level rises, only 
48 percent  of low -risk defendants are released to pretrial programs after assessment. 
Additionally, one -third of moderate -risk and 7 percent  of high- risk defendants are released to a 
pretrial program. The fact that less than half of defendants assessed as low  risk a re released to 
pretrial programs may reflect a lack of confidence on the part of judges in the use of risk assessment tools. Alternatively, it may be the case that th e low-risk defendants who are not 
released have characteristics that concern judges and th at are not picked up by the risk 
assessment tools. Finally, these relatively low release rates may reflect other county practices that limit the release of low -risk defendants. Whatever the cause, overall, only 65 percent  of 
people assessed as low  risk wer e released pretrial by any means.  
Table 11. Release Type and Overall Pretrial Release Rate by Risk Level for Assessed 
Defendants  
 
Recidivism Reduction Fund Court Gr ant Program: Final Report 2019  30 A Focus on Release of Low -Risk Defendants  
This section first looks at pretrial outcomes by risk level. The differences in new  criminal filing 
rates by release type show that low -risk defendants released as part of a pretrial pilot program 
demonstrate the lowest rates of new filings during the pretrial period.44 The differences in FTA 
are less promising for low -risk defendants.  
Arrests T hat Result in New Court Filing s 
Overall, new court filing rates (Table 12) were similar across program release types, including 
pretrial program releases, bail releases, and cite- and-releases (16 –17 percent ).45 New filing rates 
for own -recognizance releases were slightly higher at 21  percent . Notably, for low -risk pretrial 
program releases, new court filing rates of 11  percent  were much lower than for any other release 
type. These descriptive results suggest the possibility that overall recidivism ra tes could be 
reduced by releasing more low -risk defendants. Alternatively, since defendants assessed as high 
risk had significantly higher recidivism rates, overall rates could be reduced by detaining more high-risk defendants.  
Failures to Appear  
For the f our programs that were able to provide supplementary data, bail releases have lower 
observed failure -to-appear rates (24  percent ) than low -risk pretrial program releases (30  percent ). 
There could be a variety of explanations for this result . It is possible  that those released on bail 
are, as a group, at overall lower risk for FTAs to begin with as a result of wealth or some other 
characteristic. R elease type may also be confounded by differences in the characteristics of the 
populations released to a pretri al program versus those released on bail. If defendants released on 
bail are wealthier, they may have an easier time securing transportation to their court appearances , taking time off from work, and arranging for child care than defendants  who are 
unable to afford bail.  
                                                 
44 To account for the differing compositions of pretrial eligible and ineligible populations, Table 12 shows only 
pretrial- eligib le defendants. See Risk Assessment Tools and Program Eligibility (page  23) to review eligibility 
requirements for each county.  
45 Table 12 shows recidivism rates by risk level for those released to a pretrial program. Not shown in the table is 
that across all risk scores, the pretrial program release recidivism rate was 17.3 percent.  Recidivism Reduction Fund Court Gr ant Program: Final Report 2019  31 Table 12. New Criminal Activity and FTA Rates by Pretrial Program and Non- Program 
Release Types for Pretrial Program -Eligible Defendants  
 
An Application of Risk- Based Release 
One way to expand the scope and effectiveness of pretrial release programs is to remove the 
restrictions on eligibility requirements for assessments while simultaneously focusing on releasing the lowest -risk defendants first.
46 The data presented in Table 12 include outcomes by 
risk level only for those assessed b y the pretrial programs . To understand what might happen if 
the pretrial release programs were applied to all potentially eligible defendants, assessment data for the entire population of potentially eligible defendants  would be  needed.  
This section of the  report uses available data on each defendant, whether assessed or not, to 
calculate a new score for risk of new criminal activity. The tool used to construct the new score is similar to the component of the Public Safety Assessment (PSA) used for measurin g the risk of 
new criminal activity (NCA).
47 Using risk scores derived from this tool, risk levels were 
retroactively applied to all potentially  eligible arrestees booked into the county jails of the four 
pilot counties examined in this study.48 
While these findings are not generalizable to the state as a whole, they are instructive for demonstrating how risk- based release could improve pretrial outcomes. The hypotheticals in this 
section assume that risk scores are predictive regardless of releas e type, and that those detained 
can be assigned a risk score that would be accurate if they were released. While there may be unobservable differences between those who are actually detained versus those who are released, 
                                                 
46 See Attachment H, Section 3, Development of Constructed Risk Assessment Tool , for complete methodology.  
47 See PSA instrument for new criminal activity, www.psapretrial.org/about/factors . 
48 See Attachment H, Section 3, Development of Constructed Risk Assessment Tool, for additional detail. The AUC 
score was 0.61, nearly identical to scores for  tools used in the four pilot counties  (Attachment H, Section 2, Area 
Under the Curve  (AUC) ). 
 
Recidivism Reduction Fund Court Gr ant Program: Final Report 2019  32 previous studies demonstrate that risk scores appear to be generally  accurate across  all types of 
defendants .49 
Using the constructed risk level, this analysis demonstrates the potential results of expanding the 
pretrial program, focusing specifically on the issue of public safety. If publi c safety50 were the 
only pretrial concern, strictly following a pretrial tool by prioritizing the release of lowest- risk 
defendants (releasing all low -risk defendants before releasing any medium -risk defendants, and 
then releasing high -risk defendants only after all medium- risk defendants have been released) 
could reduce the rate of new criminal activity in the pretrial period and/or result in an increase of those released pretrial. According to this analysis , releasing according to risk level could reduce 
pretrial recidivism by 34  percent  while keeping release rates constant or, conversely, increase the 
number of those released pretrial by 128 percent  while maintaining the current recidivism rate.
51 
Application of the new tool yielded a risk distribution that was 22  percent  low-risk, 57 percent  
medium -risk, and 21 percent  high -risk for new criminal activity across all pretrial bookings in 
the four counties  included in the study . Given the wide variation in risk distributions observed 
across counties, this risk distribution does not match the overall distribution of the eleven pretrial 
counties, and is unlikely to match the risk distribution of the state as a whole; however, it is used in this analysis as an example.
52 Once defendants were divided into risk level s, the rates of new 
criminal activity  were applied , based on the rates of defendants released pretrial with known 
pretrial outcomes .53 The rates of new criminal activity were 1 1 percent  for the low -risk, 23 
percent  for the medium -risk, and 26 percent  for th e high -risk bookings.54 
Based on the risk distribution generated by the new instrument, the predicted recidivism rates by risk level, and an observed release rate of 25  percent ,
55 the potential benefits of risk -based 
release can be estimated. Starting with all the low -risk arrestees and working up through the risk 
distribution until the release rate reached 25 percent , this hypothetical suggests that if releases 
were solely based on risk score, the new court filing rate would drop from the observed

Working Paper No. 23180 , 2017), https://www.nber.org/papers/w23180 . 
50 As defined by new criminal filing during the pretrial period.  
51 Risk assessments are not intended to replace judicial decisionmaking; rather, risk assessment information  is 
intended to be used as a source of information that informs judicial decisionmaking. The intent of basing release 
solely on risk in this model is to illustrate to potential impact of placing more weight on the risk score.  
52 Use of the constructed tool,  not in use in any of the counties, may also account for differences between this 
distribution and other distributions.  
53 This includes defendants released pretrial such as those released on bail, OR, cite- and-release, or pretrial 
monitoring.  
54 See Attachm ent H, Section 3, Development of Constructed Risk Assessment Tool, Table 3.5.  
55 See id., Table 3.6. 
 Recidivism Reduction Fund Court Gr ant Program: Final Report 2019  33 17 percent56 in this study to a rate of 11.4 percent . This amounts to a 6 percentage -point or a 
34 percent decrease in the recidivism rate.  
Conversely, the hypothetical  can be set to keep the observed recidivism rate in this study 
(17 percent ) and allow the release rate to vary as defendants are released solely on the basis of 
recidivism risk. Under this scenario  it would be possible to increase the release rate from the 
25 percent  observed in this study to a 57 percent  release rate. This woul d amount to an overall 
increase of 32 percentage points , or 128 percent  more defendants released, while maintaining a 
17 percent  rate of recidivism.  
These hypotheticals , combined with the finding that r isk assessment tools work well to 
differentiate defend ants by risk level , have been included to provide policymakers and those 
implementing pretrial programs with information on how  courts’ reliance on risk assessment 
information has the potential to lead to the release of more pretrial defendants without an 
increase in pretrial recidivism.  
Pretrial Monitoring 
A high priority for further research is evaluating pretrial monitoring conditions to determine 
which conditions are most effective for mitigating pretrial risk of new criminal activity .57 
Although analyse s were undertaken to discern the impact of m onitoring on pretrial outcomes , the 
results were inconsistent across counties , likely as a result of wide variation in program policies  
and implementation ; as such , no definitive conclusions could be drawn. Although general 
monitoring conditions were included in the pretrial program descriptions for each county and were fairly consistent, the analyses were limited by the fact that the monitoring terms for individual defendants were not reported, a critical shortcoming in the data. In general, the 
lowest -risk defendants were released with no monitoring conditions ; moderate- risk defendants 
were released with call -in reporting conditions and may have received court date reminders ; and 
higher -risk defendants, when released, were generally subject to call -in and in- person reporting 
conditions, drug and alcohol testing, and may have also been on electronic monitoring. But without data on the types of conditions imposed on each individual it is impossible to evaluate which conditions are least restrictive and most effective for mitigating pretrial risk at each assessed risk level, warranting further research.  
                                                 
56 See supra , note 45.  
57 Understanding how to mitigate the risk of new criminal activity is a high priority in the pretrial context. A

As with most grant programs, RRF funding is meant to seed projects  that have the potential to be 
sustained and enhanced with other sources of  ongoing funding. Twenty -seven of 31 participating 
RRF courts reported plans to continue operating some or all components of their programs 
beyond the RRF grant  period, indicating courts and their justice system pa rtners see the value in 
continuing the se efforts.  
In addition to providing their communities with important services aimed at recidivism reduction, RRF grantees will also continue to serve as models for other courts and inform important policy decisions in  the years to come.

 Attachment D. Collaborative Court Program Summaries  
D-1 This attachment provides a brief description of the key program elements and a summary of 
program strengths and challenges. The summaries are drawn from program descriptions and quarterly reports submitted by each county and supplemented by information collected during site visits . 
Contra Costa County 
Program type:  Domestic Violence Intensive Support Program  
Program elements:  The goal of the Domestic Violence Intensive Support Program is to reduce 
recidivism among individuals convicted of felony and/or misdemeanor domestic violence 
offenses who have been assessed to be at medium to high risk of reoffending. To achieve these goals the court is collaborating with the district attorne y, public defender, probation, and public 
and community agencies. Participants are interviewed using the Ontario Domestic Assault Risk Assessment tool (ODARA).  
Strength:  Agreements with service providers were strengthened and clarified to assure that the 
funding provided the maximum level of services possible. 
Challenge:  Program staff struggled to identify whether the district attorney or probation was the 
most appropriate justice partner for administering the ODARA with participants.  
Kern County  
Program ty pe: Mental Health Court  
Program elements:  The goal of the mental health court is to identify persons in the criminal 
justice system whose mental health issues have contributed to their criminal behavior, with eligibility determined as soon as possible afte r criminal charges are filed. Persons eligible for the 
mental health court are offered a wide array of services including mental health and substance -
use disorder treatment, and case management including facilitation of applications for housing, public benefits, and transportation. 
Strength:  The program has a dedicated judicial officer providing leadership for the effort, helping 
to bring court and county partners together.  
Challenge:  The program staff reported a lack of in -patient substance abuse treatment  programs 
and limited availability of beds at sober living environments in Kern County, especially for 
women. 
Lake County  
Program type:  Veterans Treatment Court  
Program elements:  The Veterans Treatment Court is a voluntary program for veterans with 
crimina l charges. Cases are referred by judicial officers in the outlying courts under Penal Code Attachment D. Collaborative Court Program Summaries  
D-2 section 1170.9 for an eligibility hearing. Treatment includes weekly individual and group 
counseling, drug and alcohol testing, and if applicable, mental health trea tment, and regular 
attendance at recovery support/self -help meetings. Referrals for vocational training, education, 
and/or job placement, and housing services are provided. 
Strength:  The program includes a mentorship component for participants. 
Challenge:  Program staff reported challenges associated with Proposition 47 and difficulties 
recruiting misdemeanor participants for the program.  
Los Angeles County  
Program type:  Court to College Program  
Program elements:  The Court to College program is a collaboration between the Superior Court 
of Los Angeles County, Cerritos Community College (CCC), the Los Angeles County 
Department of Probation, the  Los Angeles County District Attorney ’s Office , the Los Angeles 
County P ublic Defender, and the California Department of Justice’s Division of Recidivism 
Reduction and Re entry. The program’s central feature is to focus its participants on an 
educational track: obtaining a high school diploma or a GED while attending a training /academic 
program at CCC. Participants must be from the Southeast Judicial District of Los Angeles 
County and be between the ages of 18 and 25. Supportive services include intensive probation 
supervision and substance -use disorder treatment services, ongoi ng court monitoring, and 
judicial interaction with participants.  
Strength:  Despite change in judicial leadership, the program continues to move forward.  
Challenge:  With multiple new law changes, staff reported that recruitment of new participants 
was a challenge. Also, California Department of Justice staff assisting with the program evaluation do not have access to probation data, and have found data on academic progress to be limited.  
Mendocino County  
Program type: Adult Drug Court  
Program elements:  The adult drug court program is for county  residents with criminal charges 
who have underlying substance -use disorder issues. The program consists of six phases that are a 
minimum of 14 weeks. In addition to substance -use disorder treatment, participants are  also 
required to perform a minimum of 488 hours of community service. The program uses sanctions that are graduated, therapeutic, and positive. Incentives are utilized to recognize and bolster the success of the participant.  
Strength:  Program staff added a peer mentor component. Attachment D. Collaborative Court Program Summaries  
D-3 Challenge:  The public defender’s office has experienced a significant staffing shortage, and 
there has been significant turnover in the district attorney’s office , creating a lack of continuity 
and teamwork in pre -court hearings.  
Merced County 
Program type s: Mental Health Treatment Court and Re -Entry Program  
Program elements:  The Mental Health Treatment Court and Re- Entry Program focuses on 
medium - and high -risk offenders on post -release community supervision, mandatory 
supervision, and felony probation who have an Axis I mental health disorder and agree to 
participate in required counseling and treatment.  
Strengths:  Program staff worked to link participants to community -based services, in addition to 
those in their court -ordered treatment plan. Services include literacy programs through the local 
library, Department of Rehabilitation programs offering employment skills and volunteer 
opportunities, National Association of Mentally Ill support groups for families, and probation departm ent programs on life skills. Participants were assisted with activating and applying for 
insurance and SSI. In some instances, probation terms were reduced for participants if they completed Behavioral Health Court. Felony charges were also reduced for som e cases, and 
fines/fees were significantly reduced for graduates.  
Challenges:  Staff sometimes struggled to find appropriate placements for participants with acute 
symptoms of  severe mental illness. There was not always a consensus on whether to allow 
someo ne into the program. Some individuals were not accepted into the program if they did not 
have time left on their probation term to complete the program. Due to the challenges  in 
recruiting  staff , the program was without a clinician in the final year. Fortu nately , another 
clinician in the Behavioral Health Court program was available to cover the necessary services for the grant participants . 
Modoc County  
Program type:  Adult Drug Treatment Court  
Program elements:  The Adult Drug Treatment Court focuses on alc ohol or drug charges or other 
charges where there was involvement of alcohol and/or drugs in the commission of the offense. The program is designed to last 18 months , with three phases and six months of aftercare. The 
treatment team includes the judge (chair), defense attorney, district attorney, coordinator, chief probation officer, substance -use disorder counselors, a mental health counselor, and an 
employment specia list. 
Strength:  Program staff utilized RRF funding to provide needed residential treatment.  
Challenge:  Modoc is a sparsely populated county with limited services dispersed across a wide 
geographic area.  Attachment D. Collaborative Court Program Summaries  
D-4 Placer County 
Program type s: Drug Court /Proposition 36 Drug Court  and Veterans Court  
Program elements:  Placer  County ’s Mental Health Court is a three- phase program for individuals 
with a diagnosis of a psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, or other psychiatric disorder that 
qualifies the participant for long -term disability.  Placer  County ’s drug courts are alternative 
sentencing programs for substance -use disorder -related criminal charges. The programs are 
designed for participants who are high need and high risk. Veterans Court is a four -phase 
program fo r veterans whose criminal charges or convictions are related to their military service.  
Strength:  A major accomplishment with this grant funding has been increased policy support for 
collaborative court programs that resulted in updates to program protocols, the revitalization of Homeless Court, the establishment of focused data collection and utilization, increased access to treatment and incentives for collaborative court participants, a successful pilot to change drug -
testing practices, and increased access to training for collaborative court staff.  
Challenge:  The court foresees ongoing challenges related to maintaining overarching policy 
support for the programs  absent the collaborative court coordinator position that was funded 
through the RRF.  
Sacramento County  
Program type:  Co-Occurring Mental Health Court  
Program elements:  The Co -Occurring Mental Health Court is a collaboration between the 
Superior Court of Sacramento County, the public defender’s office, the district attorney’s office, the Sacramento County Department of Health and Human Services (Division of Behavioral 
Health Services), and the Probation Department’s Adult Community Corrections Division and 
Alcohol and Other Drug Services  Division , and is designed to serve defendants who have   
serious mental health issue along with a co -occurring substance -use disorder.  
Strength:  The team refined the referral process yielding higher numbers of eligible referrals. 
They also worked collaboratively to finalize a program manual.  
Challenge:  Program  staff reported that they need to discharge some participants from the 
program when the services available cannot meet the needs of the client (i.e., participant s’ 
cognitive functioning does not allow for them to adhere to or comply with the structure of t he 
program). Staff also reported that they will be looking into a wider variety of services to meet more participant needs.  Attachment D. Collaborative Court Program Summaries  
D-5 San Diego County  
Program type s: Veterans Treatment Court, Mandatory Supervision Court, and Reentry Court  
Program elements:  San Diego  County ’s Veterans Treatment Court targets moderate-  to high- risk 
offenders who are eligible for relief under Penal Code section 1170.9 (offense must stem from 
military  service- related trauma, traumatic brain injury, substance -use disorder  (SUD) , or mental  
health issues). The program has three phases including an additional aftercare component. San Diego  County ’s Mandatory Supervision Court is a three -phase collaborative court program for 
offenders who have been sentenced under Penal Code section 1170(h)(5) (B) and have entered 
the post -release phase of their sentence. San Diego  County ’s Reentry Court serves high- risk 
felony offenders under parole, mandatory supervision, probation, or post -release community 
supervision who are either facing a new felony convi ction or a revocation of their terms of 
supervision. Participants must be assessed as having a SUD, or co -occurring mental health issue 
and SUD. The program aims to link participants to appropriate treatment services, including mental health issues, substa nce-use disorder, housing, employment training, and prosocial skills. 
Strength:  San Diego County has the capacity to serve a high volume of participants, particularly 
in the Mandatory Supervision Court.  
Challenge:  Staff reported that in the Veterans Treatm ent Court (VTC), participants remain in the 
screening phase for increasingly longer periods of time, due to a lack of necessary documentation (military records). This delay posed a challenge in keeping potential participants interested in participating in a highly structured program such as VTC.  
San Francisco County  
Program type s: Transitional housing component for participants in Behavioral Health Court, 
Adult Drug Court, Intensive Supervision Court, and Community Justice Center (all existing)  
Program elem ents:  San Francisco is using the funds to support transitional housing for high-
risk/high -need homeless and marginally housed clients, most of whom have co- occurring 
conditions, who are participating in one of the collaborative court programs listed above. The Tenderloin Housing Clinic (THC) blocks housing units for a maximum of 12 months in order to provide supported transitional housing to 80 collaborative court clients. Participants work with a THC housing specialist to plan for permanent housing once the participant finishes the supportive housing program in addition to receiving court -affiliated case management and social 
service support.  
Strength:  Staff reported that all participants receive a housing needs assessment and an 
individualized permanent housing plan within one week of intake.  
Challenge:  Staff reported that limits to affordable housing options have required staff to seek 
out-of-county housing options.  Attachment D. Collaborative Court Program Summaries  
D-6 San Joaquin County  
Program type s: DUI Court and Adult Drug Court  
Program elements:  San Joaq uin’s DUI Court is a dual -track system of court supervision in high-
risk DUI cases for repeat DUI offenders whose previous DUI was within 10 years of the current 
case. Track 1 is for program participants with little or no addiction issues. Track 2 is for program participants whose reoffending clearly revolves around alcoholism or substance -use disorder as 
determined by a licensed substance- use disorder counselor. The Adult Drug Court is a three -
phase program that targets individuals charged with misdemeanor  or felony offenses for which a 
jail or prison sentence will be imposed. The program provides intensive court monitoring so that 
participants can achieve total abstinence from drugs and alcohol, and become productive and 
responsible members of society.  
Strength:  Staff reported that San Joaquin County has the capacity to serve a relatively large 
number of participants in DUI and Drug C ourt programs. They have also secured continued 
funding for DUI Court and Drug Court programs through a 2017 Judicial Council  Court 
Innovations Grant. They have received additional funding from an Office of Traffic Safety Grant 
for DUI Court and a Substance Abuse Focus Grant  for both DUI and Drug Court. 
Challenge:  Staff reported that although San Joaquin County already serves a large number of 
participants in Drug Court, they have been experiencing an increase in the number of referrals, which may indicate greater need.  
San Mateo County  
Program type s: Bridges Substance Abuse Treatment Court, Pathways Mental Health Court, Drug 
Court, Veterans Treatment Court (all existing)  
Program elements:  The San Mateo County c ollaborative c ourts include a courtroom -based team 
approach with a strong judicial leadershi p role. By relaxing their traditional adversarial roles, 
Drug Court officials work as a team to develop a strategy that is in the best interest of both the defendant and society. The goal is to improve outcomes for participants by connecting them to needed  services, such as mental health treatment and therapy, substance abuse counseling, 
healthcare, job training and employment, and housing assistance. Participants are intensively 
supervised by a deputy probation officer , are expected to avail themselves of the services 
offered, must make restitution to their victims, and must appear in court for progress reviews. 
Upon graduation, participants may be eligible to have their fines reduced, have probation terminated early, and/or have their convictions  expunged/ dismissed.  
Strength:  Staff reported that RRF grants led to important capacity -building activity, especially 
for probation officers who are vital to the operations of San Mateo County ’s collaborative c ourts. 
Three probation officers were able to attend the
 National Association of Drug Court 
Professionals  training.  Attachment D. Collaborative Court Program Summaries  
D-7 Challenge:  Staff reported that the court had to work closely with partner agencies to ensure 
timely spending of grant funds, and that some agencies had difficulty spending down allocated 
funds. 
Santa Clara County  
Program type s: Drug Treatment Court, Mental Health Treatment Court, Veterans Treatment 
Court, Parolee Reentry Court, Developmentally Disabled and Competency Restoration Court  
Program elements:  The Santa Clara County collaborative justice court programs listed above are 
using funds to create a housing component that will serve the highest -risk participants who are 
dually diagnosed with mental health and substance use disorders with a high need for treatment 
and services. The housing compone nt utilizes a Housing First model and is a 30 - to 90- day 
program that provides additional treatment, case management, and other social services. 
Strength:  Santa Clara County has a complete array of collaborative courts and has the capacity to 
serve many participants. This allowed the county  to draw from multiple programs to provide 
housing to court participants. Santa Clara County has recently improved its data collection and 
reporting capacity.  
Challenge:  Santa Clara County ’s data collection capacity has l agged behind its capacity to 
provide services.  
Santa Cruz County  
Program type:  Mental Health Court  
Program elements:  Santa Cruz  County ’s Mental Health Court is a supportive postadjudication 
review court designed to improve offender treatment outcomes, reduce recidivism, respond to 
public safety and victims’ rights concerns, and effectively utilize public resources. The program 
is for individuals on specialized mental health probation supervision who agree to participate in the program. The Mental Health Court is a collaboration between the Superior Court of Santa Cruz County, probation, mental health professionals, the district attorney, defense counsel, and law enforcement.  
Strength:  Santa Cruz County has a high degree of collaboration across partner agenci es. They 
have also refined their referral process using their new case management system . 
Challenge:  The Mental Health Court in Santa Cruz County experienced some accounting delays 
that led staff to consider contracting directly with treatment providers.  Attachment D. Collaborative Court Program Summaries  
D-8 Stanislaus County  
Program type:  Veterans Court  
Program elements:  Stanislaus  County’s  Veterans Court is a collaborative justice court for 
veterans with a service- related mental health problem. In order to be eligible , the criminal 
offense must have resulted from a mental health problem, and the offense must be eligible for 
probation. Program components include full -service options at the local veterans services clinic, 
the Veterans Administration, and the county behavioral health services agency . 
Strength:  Implementation for this court was efficient. T he court reached operating capacity 
quickly after implementation.  
Challenge:  Processes for exchanging data were challenging, but have been resolved over the past 
two quarters. There may be capacity constraints  on this court based on the availability of 
probation staff.  
Tehama County 
Program type:  Mental Health Court  
Program elements:  Tehama’s mental health court is a four -phase program and targets specific 
outcomes related to increases in mental health function ing, successful community reintegration, 
and lower recidivism. Participants must be moderate - to high -risk for recidivating and must have 
a serious and persistent mental health disorder, which is the primary motivating factor in the person’s involvement wi th the criminal justice system. There may be a dual diagnosis of 
chemical dependency , though the substance -use disorder is not the primary diagnosis.  
Strength:  The court recognizes the successes among participants with services and medication 
stabilization , and has identified  alternative funding sources to potentially access after RRF 
funding ends. 
Challenge:  Tehama County reports that there is a shortage of mental health workers and 
appropriate housing options in the area. The lack of the services and housing provides a 
challenge to the court in meeting the needs of program participants.  
Tulare County  
Program type s: Domestic Violence (DV) Court and DUI Court  
Program elements:  Tulare County ’s Domestic Violence Court is a three -phase program that 
requires completion of a 52- week Batterer’s Treatment Program. The program is incentivized by 
the provision of job training/job placement in Phase 3 and the ability to reduce the term of 
probation from three years to 18 months  upon successful completion of batterer’s treatment and 
the payment of victim restitution. The DUI C ourt is a three -phase program that requires 
completion of a 12- , 18-, or 24- month Driving Under the Influence Program. The program is Attachment D. Collaborative Court Program Summaries  
D-9 incentivized by the pr ovision of job training/job placement in Phase 3 and the ability to reduce 
the term of probation from five years to three years upon successful completion of the designated 
DUI program and the payment of victim restitution.  
Strength:  The court has devoted resources to the analysis and validation of the assessment tools 
being used in DV Court and DUI Court. They have also determined that staff and providers would benefit from updated training on evidence -based practices . 
Challenge:  The most significant challenge for the DV Court has been a higher failure rate as 
compared to the DUI Court. This led to a review and adjustment of the D V supervision practices, 
required training for all DV providers on evidence -based practices, and the adoption of a system 
that tracks offenders who have failed the DV program in hopes of identifying unmet program/referral needs of these participants.  
Tuolumne County  
Program type:  Adult Drug Court  
Program elements:  Tuolumne  County ’s adult drug court program  is for offenders with criminal 
offenses that are related to drug addiction. The program provides outpatient groups, requires 12 -
step meeting attendance, frequent and random drug testing, and weekly or twice -monthly court 
hearings. The program also address es issues of housing, mental health needs, employment, and 
education.  
Strength:  The drug court program’s treatment t eam has had consistent participation from the 
probation department, behavioral health, and the courts . Over the years, it has  had the same 
clinicians, program manager, probation officer, and judge, which has resulted in a team that is 
cohesive, communicates well, and is committed to the program and the positive outcomes of participants.  
Challenge:  The court team reports that the county jail is  overcrowded, limiting the ability of the 
court to use flash incarcerations as a sanction. 
Ventura County  
Program type s: Mental Health Court and Veterans Court  
Program elements:  Ventura County ’s Veterans Court is for veterans of U.S. military service who  
have been honorably discharged or in some cases have general/other than honorable discharges and are suspected of having sexual trauma, traumatic brain injury, posttraumatic stress disorder, substance -use disorder, or mental health problems stemming from service. The treatment 
services provided for veterans include residential care, intensive outpatient treatment, medically supervised care, psychiatric treatment, cognitive behavioral psychotherapy, drug and alcohol testing, drug and alcohol therapy, and ve teran peer support groups that enhance the veteran’s 
social and occupational functioning. Ventura  County ’s Mental Health Court is for adult mentally Attachment D. Collaborative Court Program Summaries  
D-10 ill offenders who have a primary Axis I, DSM -IV diagnosis. Those determined to have a co-
occurring substanc e-use disorder diagnosis, in addition to the other Axis I diagnoses, are also 
eligible. This program provides specialized substance -use disorder counseling, general 
psychotherapy, group therapy, case management services, and psychiatric medication. 
Strengt h: The court created a database in -house to store data and run reports for both mental 
health and veterans treatment court program.  
Challenge:  The public defender’s office has proposed the expansion of the Veterans Treatment 
Court. Currently the court and other partner agencies do not have the resources to expand the 
program.  E-1 Attachment E. Collaborative Courts Data Table s 
 Data represent individuals for whom program entry data were received by the Judicial Council. 
Court programs that existed prior to the start of the grant data reporting period, beginning July 1, 2015, were given the option of submitting data for those part icipants enrolled on that date who had 
entered their programs earlier if those data were available. The following courts were able to provide at least some data for this group: Mendocino (Drug), Merced  (Mental Health), Placer (Drug, 
Mental Health, Prop. 36, and Veterans Treatment), San Francisco (Multiple), San Joaquin (DUI), Santa Clara (Multiple), Santa Cruz (Mental Health), Tehama (Mental Health), Tulare (Domestic Violence), and Tuolumne (Drug). Courts with existing programs that were not able to provide  
information on individuals entering their programs prior to that date may have had larger caseloads and additional program exits or other outcome measures during the reporting period than are represented in these tables.

 Attachment F. Pretrial Release Program Summaries  
F-1 This attachment provides a brief description of the key program elements and a summary of 
program strengths and challenges. The summaries are drawn from program descriptions and quarterly reports submitted by each county and supplemented by information collected during site visits.  
Alameda County  
Assessment tool: Ohio Risk Assessment System (ORAS -PAT ) 
Assessment administered by: Court Pretrial Services unit 
Assessment conducted:  At arraignment  
Release decision made:  At hearing subsequent to arraignment  
Supervised pretrial release options:  None  
Treatment services offered:  No 
Strength:  Data outcomes of those released on bail and those released on OR are comprehensive. 
Alameda County recently added a second courthouse where risk assessments are conducted.  
Challenge:  The program supervision component will be conducted by a community -based 
agency but was significantly delayed. The new supervision implementation was  targeted to begin 
in the fall of 2017.  
El Dorado County  
Assessment tool: Virginia Pretrial Risk Assessment Instrument (VPRAI)  
Assessment administered by: Probation  
Assessment conducted:  At arrest  
Release decision made:  At arraignment  
Supervised pretrial release options:  Reminders and probation meetings  
Treatment services offered:  Yes 
Strength:  The court recognized that they needed to make some program changes in order to 
increase the number of pretrial releases. They sought guidance from outside subject matter 
experts, b rought in experienced personnel, and are reevaluating program policy and processes.  
Challenge:  The program’s current pretrial release criteria limits eligibility and has resulted in 
relatively low program numbers. 
Fresno County  
Assessment tool: Virginia Pretrial Risk Assessment Instrument (VPRAI)  
Assessment administered by: Probation  Attachment F. Pretrial Release Program Summaries  
F-2 Assessment conducted:  At booking 
Release decision made:  At arraignment  
Supervised pretrial release options:  Reminders and monitoring  
Treatment services offered:  Yes 
Strength:  The court is starting a project to build a portal and an app to facilitate secure, mobile 
communications between probationers on pretrial supervision and the probation department.  
Challenge:  The court faces challenges in maintaining updated information ab out service provider 
availability.  
Imperial County  
Assessment t ool: Correctional Assessment and Intervention System (CAIS)  
Assessment administered by: Sheriff  
Assessment conducted:  At booking 
Release decision made:  At arraignment  
Supervised pretrial release options:  Call or report in depending on risk level  
Treatment services offered:  No 
Strength:  Imperial  County ’s pretrial a ssessment tool was studied and validated by San Diego 
State University and determined to be predictive. Suggested changes made during the validation 
process were implemented, including widening the “Low Risk” category.  
Challenge:  Configuring the jail management system to interface with court and pretrial data has 
presented significant challenges for the program.  
Lassen County  
Assessment tool: Ohio Risk Assessment System (ORAS)  
Assessment administered by: Probation  
Assessment conducted:  Pre-arraignment  
Release decision made:  At arraignment  
Supervised pretrial release options:  Monitoring via telephone; physical check- in 
Treatment services offered:  No 
Strength:  This small county program worked collaboratively as a partnership to craft a pretrial 
services agreement and make it available at the appropriate time so all parties can make informed decisions about each individual’s pretria l plan.  
Challenge:  The county reports some challenges identifying the ideal point in the pre -arraignment 
process to conduct the assessment.  Attachment F. Pretrial Release Program Summaries  
F-3 Monterey County  
Assessment tool: Ohio Risk Assessment System Pretrial Assessment Tool (ORAS -PAT)  
Assessment administ ered by:  Probation  
Assessment conducted:  Pre-arraignment  
Release decision made:  At arraignment  
Supervised pretrial release options:  Check -in with the pretrial program, electronic monitoring, 
home visits, drug and alcohol testing, and court date reminders  
Treatment services offered:  No 
Strength:  Program staff worked with BetaGov, a nonprofit agency that promotes innovation in 
the public sector, to conduct a randomized control trial of the impact of court reminders on 
failure -to-appear rates. Preliminary resu lts suggest that court appearance rates improved when 
defendants received court reminders, and the project will be extended until results are conclusive.  
Challenge:  Referrals for pretrial risk assessment have increased but probation department staff 
assigned to the pretrial program has decreased. The court and probation are transitioning to new information management systems resulting in data collection challenges.  
Orange County 
Assessment tool: Virginia Pretrial Risk Assessment Instru ment (VPRAI)  
Assessment administered by: Court  
Assessment conducted:  At booking 
Release decision made:  At arraignment  
Supervised pretrial release options:  Check -ins with probation 
Treatment services offered:  Yes 
Strength s: The University of California, Irvine assessed  the Pretrial Assessment and Release 
Supervision Program (PARS) . It found that the program positively impacted release rates, and 
that defendants placed on PARS were significantly less likely to fail pretrial  relative to those 
released on cash bond. Orange County also developed and implemented an electronic database and information exchange platform to automate transfer of program data between the court and 
probation department. The county as a whole underwent cultural change in how they view and approach the pretrial population and pretrial process. 
Challenges:  Legislative changes such as Prop. 47, Prop. 63, and SB 10 affected the number of 
eligible program participants, imposed additional rules that led to changes in court processes, and 
as of 2019 will impose new policies and procedures. Attachment F. Pretrial Release Program Summaries  
F-4 Shasta County  
Assessment tool: Virginia Pretrial Risk Assessment Instrument (VPRAI)  
Assessment administered by: Probation  
Assessment conducted:  Monday through Friday at booking  (formerly  assessments were  
conducted on Saturday and Sunday)  
Release decision made:  Pre-arraignment and at arraignment  
Supervised pretrial release options:  Reminders, check -ins 
Treatment services offered:  Yes 
Strength:  County self -identified a need to reevaluate program eligibility and expand criteria.  
Challenge:  High rate of failures to appear ; data coming from three different sources sometimes 
conflicts and requires cross -checking. More defendants than anticipated committed crimes too 
serious to allow their release on supervised ow n recognizance. Our release numbers were 
therefore much lower than we hoped for.  
Solano County  
Assessment tool: Ohio Risk Assessment System (ORAS)  
Assessment a dministered by: Probation  
Assessment conducted:  At booking 
Release decision made:  At arraignment  
Supervised pretrial release options:  Phone reminders, probation check- in 
Treatment services offered:  Yes 
Strength:  Solano County Administrator’s O ffice has been tasked with investigating expansion of 
pretrial programs. New probation officer resources added to the program. 
Challenge:  Slower than anticipated timeline for identifying IT vendor for criminal minute order 
project.  
Sonoma County  
Assessment t ool: Sonoma Pretrial Risk Assessment Tool (SPRAT)  
Assessment a dministered by: Sheriff  
Assessment conducted:  At booking 
Release decision made:  At arraignment  
Supervised pretrial release options:  Court reminders, basic supervision, moderate supervision, 
enhanced supervision  
Treatment services offered:  No Attachment F. Pretrial Release Program Summaries  
F-5 Strength:  The Sonoma County program has been releasing a gradually increasing number of 
offenders on supervised pretrial release.  
Challenge:  The inability to generate a unique ID for program participants so they can be tracked 
through data coming from multiple sources remains a challenge for Sonoma  County . They are  
also in the process of converting to a new case management system, which is consuming 
significant resources to put in place.  
Yuba County  
Assessment tool: Ohio Risk Assessment System (ORAS -PAT ). In addition to using an ORAS -
PAT score, Yuba also used an additional set of stability factors, severity of current offense factors, and severity of prior offenses to determine whether the defendant would be detained, would be released on OR pre -arraignment, released on OR with conditions pre -arraignment, or 
released  on OR with conditions at arraignment.  
Assessment a dministered by: Probation  
Assessment conducted:  At booking 
Release decision made:  Pre-arraignment and at arraignment  
Supervised pretrial release options:  Reminders and monitoring  
Treatment services offered : No 
Strength:  Risk assessment information is collected in electronic form. Use of the court’s JALAN 
case management system and a customized database allow further dynamic data tracking and predominantly automated reporting capabilities.  
Challenge:  The county is concerned it will not be able to continue the program without grant 
funding.

Recidivism Reduction Fund Court Grant Program: Final Report 2019  H-5Section 2. Area Under the Curve (AUC)  
AUCs are a commonly used measure of predictive accuracy.  The AUC answers the following 
questions: If you take a random person who failed pretrial and a random person who succeeded 
pretrial, how likely is it that the  tool rated the person who fail ed as higher risk? There is some 
debate over what is considered an acceptable AUC score in criminal justice risk assessment. Most revalidation studies for pretrial tools have AUC values in the mid-0.6 range .  
Table H2.1 : AUCs by Risk T ool and Failure Type 
Attachment H. Supplemental Pretrial Data and Analysis
Recidivism Reduction Fund Court Grant Program: Final Report 2019  H-6Section 3. Development of Constructed Risk Assessment Tool  
For the purposes of this report a risk assessment tool was constructed to predict risk of new arrest 
resulting in a new criminal filing. Tool development was based on a total of 86,886 potentially eligible bookings from across the four counties that  also h ad enough data to construct the pseudo 
risk score described below. The risk factors and weights are shown below and the AUC for constructed risk assessment tools was similar to the scores for the tools used in the pilot counties (0.61).  
The pilot risk tool created for this analysis is identical to the 
PSA New Criminal Activity (NCA) 
instrument , except that data limitations precluded the identification of exact dates for failures to 
appear ( FTAs ). Thus, prior FTAs  were not restricted exclusively to the past two years. The seven 
factors used to predict NCA and the assigned points associated with each factor are shown in 
Table H3.1. 
Table H3.1: Pilot Tool Risk Factors and Assigned Points 
Risk Factor  Points  
Age at current arrest  23 or older = 0 
22 or younger = 2  
Pending charge No = 0  
Yes = 3  
Prior misdemeanor conviction  No = 0  
Yes = 1  
Prior felony conviction  No = 0  
Yes = 1  
Prior violent conviction 0 = 0 
1 = 1 
2 = 1 
3 or more = 2  
Prior failure to  appear 0 = 0 
1 = 1 
2 or more = 2  
Prior sentence to incarceration  No = 0  
Yes = 2  
P
oints were assigned based on each risk factor and totaled. The total points where then scaled to 
create an NCA scaled score according to Table H3.2. The NCA scaled score w as then used to 
create “low ,” “medium ,” and “high” risk categories as shown in Table H3.3. Attachment H. Supplemental Pretrial Data and Analysis  
 
Recidivism Reduction Fund Court Gr ant Program: Final Report 2019  H-7 Note that the PSA does not use scaled scores to place defendants into low, medium , and high 
categories. The PSA NCA score is intended to be used in conjunction with a score for risk of 
FTA and a risk flag for violent NVA. This report does not endorse the use of this component alone, but rather based on the available data, uses this measure as a proxy for risk of new criminal activity and categorizes defendants into l ow, medium , and high groups for ease of 
explanation.

ection 3 calculations. Based on the risk distribution generated by the new instrument (Table 
H3.4), the predicted recidivism rates by risk level (Table H3.5), and an observed release rate of 
25 percent , the potential benefits of risk- based release were estimated using the following 
equations: 
Holding release rate constant at 25% 
[.22*.098 (all low risk) + .03*.22 (3% of medium risk)]/.25 (total releases) = .114 (11.4% 
recidivism rate)  
Holding recidivism rate constant at 17.3% 
[.22*.098 (all low risk) + X*.22 (X% of medium risk)]/[.22 + X] (total release rate) = .173 
(17.3% recidivism rate), x = .35, .22 + .35 = .57 (57% projected release rate)","The Honorable Holly J. score uses seven risk factors to predict New Criminal Activity (NCA). The score ranges from 0-13 and is used to categorize defendants into ""low"", ""medium"", and ""high"" risk groups. The risk assessment tool was tested and found to have an AUC of 0.61, similar to other tools used in pilot counties.","
The tool uses 7 factors to predict NCA:

1. Age at current arrest
2. Pending charge
3. Prior misdemeanor conviction
4. Prior felony conviction
5. Prior violent conviction
6. Prior failure to appear (FTA)
7. Prior sentence to incarceration

Each factor is assigned points, and the total points are scaled to create an NCA score. The NCA score is then used to categorize defendants into ""low"", ""medium"", and ""high"" risk groups.

The document also presents tables summarizing the results:

Executive Summary 
The Work Group on Homelessness , established by  Chief Justice Tani G. Cantil -Sakauye, 
recommends that the Judicial Council review and receive its final report and recommendations. 
The report recommends ways the judicial branch might work with the Governor, the Legislature, and other entities to  address homelessness, and  identifies  how court programs and services might 
be improved to incr ease access and assistance for court users experiencing or at risk of 
experiencing homelessness. I mplementation of the recommendations  is likely to make significant 
progress toward reducing homelessness while broadening access to the courts and promoting 
efficiencies and cost savings. The recommendations not only urge improvement and expansion 
of certain existing court programs with proven value, but also identify innovative new ideas for 
the California judicial branch based on available evidence and data. The recommendations will 
require funding and a coordinated approach among the state branches of government and other justice partners and stakeholders.  2 Recommendation 
The Work Group on Homelessness recommends that the Judicial Council , effective November 
19, 2021, review and r eceive the attached Work Group on Homelessness : Report to the Chief 
Justice. 
Relevant Previous Council Action 
At the Judicial Council meeting on March 12, 2021, the Work Group on Homelessness provided 
to the council an interim re port t hat briefly described the work group’s initial progress and steps 
that it would take to formulate recommendations in preparation of this final report. 
Analysis/Rationale 
In her State of the Judiciary address on March 10, 2020, the Chief Justice announced her 
intention to establish a Work Group on H omelessness to evaluate how court programs, 
processes, technology, and communications might be improved to better serve people experiencing or at risk of experiencing homelessness, and to consider how the judicial branch might appropriately work with the executive and legislative branches to reduce homelessness. The formation of the work group was delayed because of  the COVID-19 pandemic but was 
formally announced on October 23, 2020. 
The work group met remotely and regularly from November 2020 through August 2021. Work 
group members were assigned to subgroups to investigate and analyze specific topics, and to allow the work group to explore multiple tracks simultaneously. Work group members engaged in hundreds of meetings and interviews with state and local leaders, experts, advocates, justice partners, service providers, members of the judicial branch , and  community members, including 
individuals who have thems elves experienced homelessness .
1 These interviews and meetings 
were conducted from November 2020 through July 2021. The work group also solicited and received informal public comment. The attached report is the first formal submission of the work group’s recommendations to the Chief Justice and the Judicial Council. The work group sunsets on December 31, 2021. 
1 Members of the  Work Group on Homelessness met or spoke with  numerous  individuals and entities, including 
leaders and representatives from the Governor’s Office; the Legislature; the Governor’s Homeless and Supportive 
Housing Advisory Task Force; the Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency; the Homeless Coordinating 
and Financing Council; the Office of the California Surgeon General; the California Highway Patrol; the California 
State University; the State Bar of California; American Guard Services , Inc. ; the California State Association of 
Counties; the counties of Alameda, Butte, Imperial, Marin, San D iego, Santa Clara, Sonoma, and Ventura; the cities 
of Bakersfield , Chico, Gridley, Los Angeles, Oroville, Paradise, and Sacramento ; the California Judges Association; 
the County Behavioral Health Directors Association of Californi a; WomenHaven , A Center for Family Solutions; 
the California Building Industry Association; the California Rental Housing Association; the California Apartment Association; the National Homelessness Law Center; the Western Center on Law & Poverty; the Inner City Law 
Center; Califor nia Rural Legal Assistance, Inc.; and the Tenderloin Housing Clinic. Work group members also met 
with leaders within the judicial branch , individuals who have experienced homelessness,  and individuals 
knowledgeable about homeless and collaborative courts, unlawful detainer and housing courts, and the California 
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).  3 Policy implications 
Responding to the charge from the Chief Justice, the wor k group developed the following  
recommendations that may have policy implications for the judicial branch , the courts, or both. 
Action Area 1: Improve unlawful detainer proceedings to r educe h omelessness and promote 
housing s tability.  
•Recommendation 1.1. Encourage and support legislative efforts to create and fund a
statewide program that provides full -scope legal representation in residential unlawful

homelessness.  
•Recommendation 4.1. Educate judicial officers and judicial branch personnel on issues
relating to homelessness.
•Recommendation 4.2. Engage with other public and private entities and individuals toenhance programs and services for people without housing or at risk of losing housing.
Comments 
Although the recommendations were not circulated for public comment, informal public comment was sought and received during the development of the work group recommendations. In addition, t he work group drew information from numerous studies, reports, articles, seminars, 
video presentations, news stories, interviews with state and local stakeholders, and legal opinions addressing homelessness.  
The i nformal public comment was so licited  from March 17 through April 23, 2021, via the Work 
Group on Homelessness webpage on the California Courts website and through Court News Update . The work group also obtained c omment through meetings with relevant Judicial Council 
advisory bodies, such as the Trial Court Presiding Judges Advisory Committee , Court Executives 
Advisory Committee , Information Technology Advisory Committee, and Collaborative Justice 
Courts Advisory Committe e. 
Based on those efforts, the work group identified what it believes are the most meaningful ways that the courts and the judicial branch can help to address homelessness and better serve court 
users.  Each recommendation is the culmination  of much study and discussion, and each includes 
background to explain the problems and issues that it is  designed to address. 
Alternatives considered 
The Work Group on Homelessness was directed to report its findings and recommendations to 
the Chief Justice and the Judicial Council. Accordingly, no alternatives to submitting a report were considered, although alternatives to particular recommendations are discussed in the report . 
The report is intended to provide the Chief Justice with various options for implementation . 
Fiscal and Operational Impacts  
Reviewing and receiving the report has no fiscal or operational impact. It is anticipated that 
implementation of the recommendations will have the impacts  discussed in the report. The work 
group identified potential considerations for the implementation of each recommendation —
including factors that may affect costs and operations—and also identified recommendations that 
may result in a cost savings to the Judicial Council or to the c ourts.

Chair, Judicial Council of California  
455 Golden Gate Avenue  
San Francisco, California 94102 
Dear Chief Justice Cantil -Sakauye : 
We present for your consideration the final report of the Work Group on Homelessness. This 
report is the culmination of research, investigation, solicitation of public comment, and hundreds of meetings and interviews with leaders, experts, advocates, justi ce partners, service providers, 
and members of the judicial branch and the community, including individuals  who have 
experienced homelessness. As a result of our efforts, we identif y what we believe are the most 
meaningful ways the courts and the judicial branch can help to address homelessness and better 
serve court users who are without permanent housing or are housing insecure . 
Subgroups were tasked with exploring various relevant topics, such as the causes of 
homelessness; preferred definitions and terminology; judicial opportunities to reduce barriers 
faced by people experiencing homelessness;  improvement of e viction proceedings to help 
support housing stability; the role of technology in increasing communication, information , and 
access to justice for these vulnerable court users ; existing judicial branch best practices; and 
additional ways the judicial branch can work with other government leaders and entities in addressing homelessness.  
The recommendations in this report urge improvement and expansion of certain existing court programs with  proven value. They  also identify innovative ideas that would be new for the 
California judicial branch —ideas that we believe, based on the available evidence and data, 
would have a significant  impact in reducing hom elessness while broadening access to the courts 
and promoting efficiencies and cost savings . The recommendations will require funding and a 
coordinated approach among the state branches of government and other justice partners and stakeholders.  
On behalf of the w ork group members and assigned Judicial Council staff, we thank you for the 
opportunity to serve on this project and to address this important issue of statewide and national concern. On a personal note, the chairs wish to thank the work group members and staff for their extraordinary commitment and effort. vi We appreciate your leadership in ensuring that all the people of California, regardless of their 
housing circumstances, will find equal access to justice in our courts. It is an honor and privilege to assist you and the judicial branch with this vision.

1 Executive Summary  
In October 2020, Chief Justice Tani G. Cantil- Sakauye created the Work Group on 
Homelessness to evaluate how court programs, processes, technology, and communications 
might be improved to better serve people who are without housing or are housing insecure. The work group was asked to examine existing court services and to consider how the judicial br anch 
might appropriately work with the executive and legislative branches to reduce homelessness. In announcing the work group, the Chief Justice recognized that California courts are centers for social justice.
1 In furtherance of that important role, the work group is pleased to present the 
recommendations described  in this report.  
To develop its recommendations, the work group drew information from numerous studies, 
reports, articles, seminars, video presentations, news stories, and legal opinions that addressed homelessness.
2 The work group also considered many significant federal, state, and community 
efforts targeting the issue.3 Finally, the work group solicited public comment and engaged in 
hundreds of mee tings and interviews with state and local leaders, experts, advocates, justice 
partners, service providers, and members of the judicial branch and the community, including 
individuals who have themselves experienced homelessness.  
While  assessing how the judicial branch might best address the homelessness crisis, the work 
group was mindful that courts and judicial officers must operate within the framework of their constitutional authority and ethical obligations
4 to ensure equal access to justice and that the 
executive and legislative branches exercise the prerogative to set public policy, enact laws, and provide funding for mandated services and programs. Within this constitutional framework, the work group identified many opportunities for the judicial br anch to meaningfully address 
homelessness while also broadening access to the courts  and creating efficiencies and cost 
savings . Because courts are involved in legal determinations that can remove individuals from 
their residence and affect their ability t o obtain future housing —whether by way of evictions, 
foreclosures, criminal judgments, restraining orders, civil commitments, or other actions —courts 
are also in a position to help ensure, with support and collaboration from those outside the branch, that legal actions need not result in homelessness.  The report emphasizes, however, that 
such support and collaboration will be essential. As this report explains, the recommendations 
will require funding and a coordinated approach among the state branches of government , justice 
partners , and other stakeholders.  
Terminology  
As a starting point , the work group recognized that all court users —including individuals who 
lack housing or are housing insecure —should be afforded dignity and respect in their 
interactions with the courts. A major component of ensuring dignity and respect is the use of appropriate language when dis cussing homelessness.  Executive Summary  
2 Experts and advocates in the field widely agree  that the word “homeless” to describe a person is 
inaccurate and inconsistent with the concept of people -first language, which recognizes that a 
person should not be defined by a single l imitation or circumstance. A people- first phrase such as 
“a person without housing” affords dignity by putting the person first  while acknowledging that 
the person may lack permanent shelter and yet  still have a place to call home. Though contrary 
views ex ist, numerous experts and advocates in the field believe the use of people -first language 
is a positive step in reducing stigma and improving outcomes by emphasizing the potentially 
temporary circumstance of being without housing. The work group therefore adopts and 
recommends use of such language. The work group also uses the terms “homelessness” and “homeless courts,” because  the former is nationally understood and accepted as describing a 
circumstance rather than a person and the latter is a court descri ption that has been commonly 
recognized and adopted.  
Causes of Homelessness and the Barriers Faced by People 
Without Housing  
To inform its work, the work group examined the many root causes of homelessness and housing 
insecurity, such as situational and ge nerational poverty, community and family violence, 
unemployment, low wages, disability, medical and mental illness, substance use, and lack of needed treatment or services.
5 Lack of affordable housing is a major cause of homelessness: 
experts estimate tha t California is at least 3 million housing units short of current need.6 
Eviction, foreclosure, conviction, incarceration, civil commitment, debt, increased medical or mental health deterioration or trauma, and loss of a driver’s license or transportation  are some of 
the circumstances of homelessness that may flow from the underlying causes. Being without housing can expose a person to legal consequences —such as punishment for loitering, indecent 
exposure, trespassing, or a failure to appear in court —creating a cycle that is difficult to escape.  
Systemic inequality and discriminatory housing practices also significant ly contribut e to 
homelessness. Studies show that homelessness disproportionately affects those who have already been marginalized or are highly vulnerable,
7 such as people of color,8 members of the 
LGBTQIA +9 community,10 youth,11 foster youth,12 the elderly,13 military veterans , and people 
who have been incarcerated or convicted. Moreover, although it is illegal to discriminate in housing sales, rentals, and lending, equal opportunity does not exist for all. Information gathered by the work group indicates that explicit and implicit biases  and systemic disparities continue to 
exist and affect housing access and reten tion. For example, r acial disparities exist in criminal 
arrests and convictions, and i ndividuals who are Hispanic  and Black are more likely to be 
sentenced to prison than similarly situated white  individuals.
14 These circumstances can lead to 
housing instability because a  history of incarceration increases the likelihood that a person will 
experience homelessness  by 10 to 13 times .15 
The work group sought to identify the barriers that individuals who are without housing or are housing insecure  experience in accessing court services and meeting court -mandated obligations. Executive Summary  
3 Significantly, homelessness is itself a barrier that impedes the ability of people to engage with 
the court and the justice system. Being without  housing typically relegates a person to the bottom 
of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs,16 where court obligations are not a priority because of day -to-
day struggles to meet basic physiological needs like food, water, cooling or warmth, rest, and safety.
17 Many  persons without housing face emotional obstacles and strive to avoid contact with 
law enforcement and the courts based on prior negative interactions,18 feelings of distrust, or 
perceptions that the judicial system lacks empathy for their circumstances.19 Likewise, fear or 
feelings of intimidation may delay or deter people from participating in the court process20 or 
even entering a courthouse.21 Some may also feel hopeless22 or stuck in “survival mode” without 
a lifeline.23 
For those  experiencing homelessness who need or desire to connect with the court, transportation 
and other barriers can hinder their efforts. Their circumstances make keep ing track of hearing 
dates and times difficult, and insufficient access to free Wi -Fi service or cellphone charging 
stations complicates communication efforts with courts and justice partners.24 Simply getting to 
the courthouse can  be problematic when public transportation is limited or unavailable 
depending on location, service is infrequent, and the cost is u naffordable.25 Even when public 
transportation vouchers are provided, using such transportation and entering a courthouse may be impossible for people  unable to arrange for child care, pet care, or safe storage of  their 
belongings.
26 
Finally, the lack of opportunities for adequate bathing and grooming may pose additional barriers to transportation and court access based on ostracism and self -consciousness.
27 Chronic pain, 
disability, and undiagnosed or untreated medical and mental health conditions can  also impede 
efforts to get to court.28 And people  who can make it to the courthouse may still have difficulty 
understanding what is happening, resulting in yet another obstacle to successful engagement with the courts.
29 
Public Concern Over  Homelessness  
The wo rk group is aware of the public concern and frustrat ion with the circumstances of 
homelessness and the seeming proliferation of encampments . But individuals without housing 
often perceive  congregate living in encampments as a safer alternative to the shelter system or 
living alone .30 Moreover, individuals  in encampments  are more likely to be victims of crime than 
the perpetrators of it .31 Ultimately , living in public spaces implicate s a com plex interplay 
between public health, safety, and constitutional rights —one that is playing out in the court s. 
For example, even though in most circumstances a city is not required to provide sufficient 
shelter for individuals without housing,32 the Eighth Amendment  to the U.S.  Constitution  
“prohibits the imposition of criminal penalties for sitting, sleeping, or lying outside on public 
property for homeless individuals who cannot obtain shelter” because , as it has been determined, 
sitting, sleeping , or lying outside is an unavoidable consequence of being human.33 At the same Executive Summary  
4 time, even when shelter is unavailable, it may be constitutionally permissible for a  city to 
prohibit sitting, lying, or sleeping out side at particular times or in particular locations.34 
In addition, at least one city was subjected to legal proceedings based on its practice of 
discarding the property of individuals  lacking housing without obtaining a warrant or providing 
due process.35 But city processes have been upheld where, for example, a city had standard 
operating procedures for providing advance notice of encampment  closure s and a process for 
encampment occupants to retrieve property seized during such closure s.36 
Many work group interviewees referenced a case in Los Angeles in which sweeping orders were imposed on the city based, among other things, on findings that homelessness was a byproduct of racism and a danger to huma n life .
37 On appeal, however, the preliminary injunction order was 
vacated and the matter remanded for further proceedings.38

6 Action Areas and Recommendations 
Action Area 1: Improve unlawful detainer proceedings to 
reduce homelessness and promote housing stability . 
A residential unlawful detainer proceeding is a summary proceeding that permits  a landlord to 
recover possession of leased premises from a tenant who is alleged to be wrongfully in 
possessio n.39 Although other civil remedies such as ejectment or quiet title are available, 
unlawful detainers are widely used because they advance quickly as a result of  compressed 
statutory timelines. Notably, the tenant has only five court days to respond to the  complaint,40 
and the case is entitled to a preferential trial setting.41 
In jurisdictions  that do not provide appointed counsel , tenants are rarely represented in unlawful 
detainer proceedings.42 When served with an eviction complaint, unrepresented tenants must act 
quickly to locate information about the unlawful detainer process to preserve their rights. Given the expedited nature of the proceedings, many tenants are unable to adequately understand the complexities of the process and have difficulties pr eparing and filing a response to the complaint. 
When tenants fail to file a timely response, landlords can obtain a default judgment against them without a hearing on the merits.
43 
Consequences for tenants can be significant when a judgment of eviction is entered. In addition 
to leading to removal from housing, a record of eviction negatively affects a tenant’s credit rating and makes it difficult to obtain replacement housing. The resulting loss of housing can affect entire f amilies  as well as  child education, health, and welfare .
44 
Landlords are represented by counsel in approximately 85 to 90 percent of unlawful detainer cases. Single-  or small- unit landlords, however, are sometimes  unrepresented, and they, like 
tenants , may  find the unlawful detainer process hard to understand and navigate. The difficulties 
in complying with procedural rules, which may result in courts rejecting complaints for filing, 
may be compounded by the  requirements imposed in response  to the COVID -19 pandemic.
45 In 
addition, a landlord without counsel may be less inclined to resolve a case before  judgment.  
The recommendations in Action Area 1 focus on improving unlawful detainer proceedings for both tenants and landlords. The work group concluded that providing counsel  to all who need it 
in unlawful detainer proceedings  will do much to reduce homelessness and promote housing 
stability in California.  Maximizing opportunities for alternative dispute resolution and making 
the unlawful detainer process more accessible and understandable will also yield significant benefits.  Action Areas and Recommendations  
7 Recommendation 1.1. Encourage and support legislative efforts to create and 
fund a statewide program that provides full -scope legal representation in 
residential unlawful detainer proceedings for all litigants who are unable to afford 
counsel.  
Providing counsel is crucial for ensuring equal access to justice and housing stability for people  
facing the prospect of homelessness. Counsel’s involvement can substantially assist courts in 
processing the increasing number of unlawful detainer proceedings in a fair, just, and informed manner.  
The Work Group on Homelessness recommends  the following : 
1. The Judicial Council should encourage and support legislative efforts to create and fund a statewide program that provides full -scope legal representation in residential unlawful 
detainer proceedings for all litigants who are unable to afford counsel.
46 
2. The Judicial Council should work  with the executive and legislative branches and other 
judicial partners and affected stakeholders to ensure tha t the statewide program is 
workable for all parties and does what it is intended to do.  
Background  
The court system plays an integral role throu ghout the eviction process, from the filing of an 
unlawful detainer complaint to the entering of a judgment that allows a sheriff to lock evicted tenants out of their homes. Eviction is one of the most critical civil justice issues for low -income 
tenants, with the loss of rental housing posing a wide range of adverse risks and consequences. Full-scope counsel representation greatly improves outcomes and housing stability for tenants 
facing eviction. 
As the Legislature found in 2009 when it enacted the Sarge nt Shriver Civil Counsel Act (Shriver 
Act) (Assem. Bill 590; Stats. 2009, ch.  457), there are important societal, due process, fairness, 
and fiscal reasons for providing free counsel to indigent persons in civil cases, including 
unlawful detainer cases.
47 Recogniz ing that indigent parties without representation typically lose 
their cases regardless of the merits, the Legislature found, a mong other things, that providing 
representation increases access to justice, improves outcomes for court users , and allows court 
users to make essential decisions with better understanding. Moreover, the presence of counsel advances due process and equal protection of the laws, allows courts to more efficiently and effectively process heavy caseloads, and improves public confidence in the  court system.
48 In the 
Legislature’s words, “Because in many civil cases lawyers are as essential as judges and courts to the proper functioning of the justice system, the state has just as great a responsibility to 
ensure adequate counsel is available to  both parties in those cases as it does to  supply judges, 
courthouses, and other forums for the hearing of those cases. ”
49 
The Shriver Act led to the creation of pilot projects providing counsel to eligible people with low  
income s in certain civil matters.  The act was not designed to provide an attorney for every 
unlawful detainer party who needed one; instead, the act authorized limited funding and tasked Action Areas and Recommendations  
8 the Judicial Council with administering the program. Currently, Shriver counsel is offered to a 
limite d number of people in eight counties for unlawful detainer proceedings and other housing-
related matters.50 
Importantly, the Shriver Act required studies of project outcomes for those receiving assistance.  
An in -depth study issued by NPC Research  (Northwes t Professional Consortium, Inc.)  in June 
2020 resulted in the Report to the California State Legislature for the Sargent Shriver Civil Counsel Act Evaluation (2020 Shriver report) . The 2020 Shriver report  documented the many 
beneficial effects of full -scope representation for tenants
51 and indicated that representation for 
tenants led to positive outcomes without making unlawful detainer proceedings more combative or drawn out.
52 
Rationale for t he Recommendation  
For many individuals and families, eviction l eads to homelessness.53 Low income and high rent 
impose a rental cost burden that is difficult to overcome. As reported by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, the California housing market requires the second- highest “housing 
wage” in the country— that is, the hourly wage a full -time worker must earn to afford a rental 
unit without spending more than 30 percent of their income on housing costs. The report indicated that a full -time worker in California had to earn $34.69 per hour to afford a  two-
bedroom apartment. High- cost cities like San Francisco and Santa Barbara certainly contribute to 
this high statewide rate, but even in rural and nonmetropolitan areas, California’s average 
housing wage was reported to be $18.96 per hour , the seventh m ost expensive in the country and 
well above the state’s minimum wage  of $14.00 per hour .
54 
In addition, a significant amount of data highlights the disproportionate impact of evictions on 
people of color  and women, contributing to disparities in communitie s of color experiencing 
homelessness.55 In California, Black residents represent about 6.5 percent of the population but 
account for nearly 40 percent of people  experiencing homelessness.56 One San Francisco study 
includes data showing that Black residents  make up 6 percent of the city’s population but 
represent 29 percent of all evicted tenants and 37.76 percent of adults living in shelters.57 Similar 
disparities have been observed in jurisdictions outside California.58 According to one 2020 
eviction study, Black households tend to be more rent burdened, tend to have higher levels of income volatility, and are less likely than white households to have access to resources that would help them weather unexpected events.
59 Moreover, Black tenants often face 
discrimination by landlords and are not allowed as much flexibility as their white  peers when 
they fall behind on rent, resulting in more eviction actions against them.60 
The 2020 Shriver report showed strong evidence of housing stability for tenants who rec eived 
full-scope representation by counsel in unlawful detainer proceedings.61 The report concluded 
that representation leads to dramatically fewer tenant defaults (close to zero), a significantly higher settlement rate (67 percent compared to 34 percent for unrepresented tenants), and a lower trial rate (3 percent compared to 14 percent for unrepresented tenants).
62 Of the Shriver 
represented clients who ultimately moved, the majority (83 percent) did so as part of a negotiated settlement. One year later, 71 percent of Shriver clients had obtained a new rental unit, compared Action Areas and Recommendations  
9 to 43 percent of self -represented tenants. The report also found that providing counsel to tenants 
improved court administration and efficiency because litigants asserted fewer nonmerit orious 
claims and counsel diverted cases away from court calendars and toward alternative dispute 
resolution.63 An earlier study documented similar positive outcomes  when counsel was provided 
for tenants during a one -year pilot program in San Francisco.64 
Studies in other jurisdictions also provide strong empirical evidence that assistance of counsel greatly improves outcomes and housing stability for tenants facing e viction. A study in 
Minnesota found that tenants with counsel were almost twice as likely to stay in their homes and four times less likely to use homelessness shelters than were unrepresented tenants.
65 Likewise, a 
study in Seattle found that tenants with  counsel were two  to three times more likely to negotiate 
a payment plan in order to remain in their housing.66 In New York City, study results showed 
that 8 6 percent of income -qualified renters who received full -scope representation were able to 
maintain their housing.67 And Massachusetts conducted a randomized trial in which tenants were 
assigned to one of two groups: a treatment group that received full -scope representation, and a 
control group that received limited  legal services. Data showed that, at the end of litiga tion, two-
thirds of tenants in the treatment group stayed in their homes, whereas only one -third of the 
control group retained possession of their home s.68 
The 2020 Shriver report and many other studies have documented the need for tenant 
representation . In addition, even some landlords —such as single - or small -unit landlords and 
those who rent a spare bedroom or converted garage in their home —are unable to  afford an 
attorney and could benefit from representation to help stabilize their housing. If these la ndlords 
rely on rental income as a lifeline and the rent is not paid, they could be at risk of losing their own housing. Providing counsel to these landlords would assist them in navigating the complex unlawful detainer process and in considering resolutions short of judgment, which could benefit both the landlord and the tenant.  
Fiscal Impact  
The w ork group obtained cost -benefit information for a relevant statewide program in Delaware, 
as well as information for various city and county programs. The inform ation indicated 
significant costs had been avoided as a result of the programs, with the size of the benefit varying by jurisdiction. When expressed as a per -dollar savings in costs such as shelter and health care, 
the savings ranged from $2.40 in Boston t o $12.74 in Philadelphia.
69 When expressed as an 
annual net cost savings, the savings ranged from $6 million in Delaware to $320 million in New York City.
70 
Although the studies focused primarily on shelter and health- care savings, some studies 
identified additional savings for foster care and care for unsheltered individuals.71 An overview 
of the cost savings achieved by various jurisdictions with a right to counsel program is provided in Table 1.  Action Areas and Recommendations

Note: The underlying assumption is that providing stable housing would improve health outcomes and reduce the strain on medical 
services.  
 
i Shelter savings are a direct result of decreased evictions and reflect (1) the estimated number of tenants who would have 
experienced homelessness had it not been for legal representation multiplied by (2) the average cost of sheltering an individual or 
family. This amount is based on the best available data and varies by report.  
ii Health- care savings include savings realized by a broad range of activities, including inpatient hospital costs, emergency room 
costs, and mental health costs.  
iii Foster  care savings are estimated based on a reduction of child placements as a result of housing instability and reflect 
assumptions about savings from maintenance and administration payments. 
iv Unsheltered savings, which were used only in a report on New York  City’s right- to-counsel initiative, reflect a “societal cost” that 
includes medical care and law enforcement.  
v Other savings come from, for example, decreased costs in transporting children for families experiencing homelessness, a 
reduction in housing program costs, and a decrease in lost school funding from absences . 
The cost components of providing counsel are relatively straightforward and include costs for 
administration and attorneys. A few of the studies were based on pro bono models and were 
large ly used as proof -of-concept pilots in an effort to demonstrate the merits of providing 
counsel to tenants. The projected cost to provide counsel for tenants ranged from $3.4 million in 
Delaware to $199 million in New York City. But the studies indicated that the provision of counsel for tenants facing eviction would result in significant savings, as reflected in Table 2, 
based almost entirely on decreased spending in areas related to homelessness or savi ngs related 
to funds that had been lost as a result of people experiencing homelessness.

11 Some benefits of a counsel program in unlawful detainer  proceedings  are more difficult to 
quantify, such as the 2020 Shriver report’s acknowledgment that litigants were more satisfied 
with the court process when they had counsel. In addition, a counsel program that reduces homelessness would provide many other benefits, s uch as improvements in child well -being, 
with attendant savings in juvenile justice and welfare.
73 
Opportunities and Considerations for Implementati on 
The positive outcomes documented in the 2020 Shriver report support the creation of a broader statewide program to make counsel available for all unlawful detainer litigants. To improve equal access to justice and housing stability, such a program shoul d provide counsel to 
litigants regardless of their documented or undocumented status.
74 The program should 
also have a stable annual funding source that ensures full -scope representation and 
eliminates reliance on the income limits currently imposed for Sh river and legal aid 
representation, which often exclude the working poor.
75 Creating a statewide unlawful detainer counsel program with a stable source of 
funding that avoids dependence on grant funding should make recruit ment of attorneys  for the 
program  easier .76 
Models like the Court Appointed Dependency Counsel program (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 317)77 
can provide a useful framework for the implementation of a statewide unlawful detainer counsel program. Through the  dependency program, counsel is provided f or all nongovernmental court 
users—parents and children —who appear without counsel. Rather than using income limits as an 
up-front bar to provision of counsel in dependency court, the program provides an attorney to 
any court user who appears to qualify and employs a collections program to recoup the cost of counsel from any parent who has the ability to pay. By operating in this way, the program ensures that parents and children have an attorney in every case to assist in the protection of their important rights in dependency proceedings.
78 The state allocates approximately $157  million 
annually for this program,79 and federal funds have also been leveraged.80 The program is 
administered by the Judicial Council under  a workload- based methodology created by a joint 
subcommittee of the Family and Juvenile Law Advisory Committee and the Trial Court Budget Advisory Committee .
81 This method of funding and administrat ion affords flexibility to counties 
to carry out the statutory mandate in the manner best suited to their particular county. Adopting 
this model for a statewide  assistance- of-counsel program in unlawful detainer cases  would allow 
each court to determine how best to leverage existing resources, such as current legal services agencies, to fulfill the recommended statutory mandate to provide counsel to all in need.

At least three states —Connecticut, Maryland, 
and Washington—have enacted some form of a right  to counsel in unlawful detainer cases.  
A number of cities in  California and 
elsewhere— including Baltimore, Boulder, 
Cleveland, Louisville , New York, Newark, 
Philadelphia, San Francisco, Santa Monica, and Seattle —have also enacted a right to 
counsel, many as a result of the COVID- 19 
pandemic and the prospect of increases in 
homelessness.  Action Areas and Recommendations  
12 Committee or the Advisory Committee on Providing Access and Fairness  and staff would be 
well positioned to provide subject -matter expertise to assist in these efforts.  
Recommendation 1.2. Implement and expand diversion, mediation, and 
settlement  efforts —both before and after a residential unlawful detainer 
complaint is filed —to maximize the opportunities for the landlord and tenant to 
reach a mutually agreeable resolution short of an eviction  judgment.  
Eviction diversion  is an umbrella term encompassing prefiling efforts to divert cases from an 
unlawful detainer calendar to alternative dispute resolution, such as through mediation. 
Mandatory eviction diversion programs typically require that the unlawful detainer complaint be accompanied by documentation that the plaintiff landlord has mediated without success. Mediation provides the opportunity for a landlord and tenant to reach a mutually agreed on alternative to an eviction judgment with the help of a trained, neutral mediator. A settlement conference is another alternative dispute resolution method that can help to achieve similar 
results after a complaint is filed. Alternative dispute resolution in unlawful detainer proceedings can lead to improved outcomes for all parties and reduced litigation costs.  
The Work Group on Homelessness recommends  the following : 
1. Courts should implement and expand prefiling efforts to divert unlawful detainer cases from court calendars to permit alternative dispute resolution such as mediation.  
2. For unlawful detainer matters that are unable to resolve before  the filing of an unlawful 
detainer complaint, courts should expand the availability of  postfiling court- supervised 
alternative dispute resolution services, including the potential adoption of mandatory 
settlement conferences.  
Background  
The general focus of an eviction diversion program is to address nonpayment of rent and related issues. As indicated, an eviction judgment negatively affects tenants and their families in many 
ways, including making it difficult to obtain replacement housing . Eviction diversion and 
alternative dispute resolution by mediation or settlement conference can help landlords obtain payment and/or regain possession of a property while helping tenants and thei r families avoid the 
adverse impacts of an eviction judgment. Diversion also results in reduced court costs for both sides and increased court efficiencies as litigants settle without a trial.
82 Examples of eviction 
diversion programs in other jurisdictions include the Philadelphia Eviction Diversion Program,83 
the Texas Eviction Diversion Program ,84 and Washington State’s Eviction Resolution Pilot 
Program.85 
It bears emphasizing  that an eviction diversion program should be implemented in conjunction 
with a  program providing counsel for unlawful detainer litigants who cannot afford an attorney. 
As the U.S. Attorney General’s Office recently pointed out, provid ing access to counsel from the 
outset is important to ensure that diversion programs promote just ou tcomes and do not 
perpetuate structural advantages typically held by landlords.86 Action Areas and Recommendations  
13 Rationale for t he Recommendation  
It is very common for unlawful detainer cases to end in default judgments,87 and defaults can 
occur rapidly because of  tight statutory deadlines. Without an attorney, tenants may be unable to 
respond to an unlawful detainer complaint in a timely fashion and may not even understand the 
need to respond. Requiring neutral, mediated discussions before  the filing of an unlawful 
detainer complaint—with the understanding that a complaint can be filed as a last resort rather than as the initial step in resolving a rental dispute —may allow landlords and tenants to resolve 
cases with less expense and without  an eviction judgment.  
The Shriver pilot projects show that cases involving counsel tend to result in fewer judgments against tenants, as well as better opportunities for tenants to find alternate, stable housing and long- term housing stability.
88 Resoluti ons short of judgment were reached 70 percent of the time, 
and landlords benefited by regaining their property more quickly and without having to go through the trouble and expense of a trial or executing a writ of possession.
89 Among surveyed 
property owners, more than 70 percent stated that they would be inclined to address tenant nonpayment or late payment outside court, and over 69 percent believed that mediation is more time- and cost -efficient than pursuing legal action because it saves them attorney’ s fees, filing 
fees, sheriff’s fees, and transition costs.
90 
The U.S. Attorney General’s Office recommends that our judicial branch consider eviction diversion strategies to “help families avoid the disruption and damage that evictions cause.”
91 As 
the off ice also  recognizes, such strategies “encourage landlords and tenants to resolve disputes 
without formal adjudication and increase the chance that tenants can stay in their homes.”92 
Optimally, a diversion program should be mandatory , to ensure partic ipation and 
maximize effectiveness. For example, a mandatory program could require that the unlawful detainer complaint contain or attach a declaration that the landlord has contacted the tenant or has tried with due diligence to locate the tenant, and if the tenant was located, has participated in the diversion mediation program without success. Although such a declaration is not presently required in California unlawful detainer cases, other statutes require certain actions before  the filing of a complain t. For instance, 
Assembly Bill 832 (Stats. 2021, ch. 27) requires plaintiff landlords who seek to recover on COVID- 19 rental debt to attach documentation to their complaints showing they have worked to 
obtain rental assistance relief.
93 
For matters that ar e unable to resolve before  the filing of an unlawful detainer complaint, courts 
should consider requiring a further effort at resolution before  trial. Cases may be more likely to 
settle when there has been discovery or when a trial date looms. Although such an effort may The Superior Court of Alameda 
County has had success in resolving 
unlawful detainer cases by holding 
mandatory settlement conferences, which also offer an opportunity to identify and direct individuals who might experience homelessness to 
housing resources.  Action Areas and Recommendations  
14 require consideration of an extension of the time for trial, it would provide an additional 
opportunity for a resolution that r educes costs and does not result in a judgment of eviction.  
Fiscal Impact  
The availability of prefiling eviction diversion, including eviction mediation, would provide numerous court efficiencies as litigants choose mediation and settle outside of court, t hus 
diverting cases away from the court calendar.
94 Although implementing diversion successfully 
would require additional resources —such as mediators, self -help staff, and housing resource 
navigators —such efforts would mark a logical extension of the self -help and court navigator 
programs that already exist and have proven successful in assisting court users with unlawful detainer matters.  
The Judicial Council and the courts should consider leveraging existing resources or obtaining 
new resources and partne ring with state and local stakeholders to implement these services. State 
programs with rental assistance components tend to be supported in part by federal funding under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), 15 U.S.C. § 9001 et seq.; other programs make  use of local and/or private source funding.
95 The California Access 
to Justice Commission is leading an initiative to support free remote mediation to assist 
unrepresented tenants and landlords, and several courts have expressed interest in such 
services.96 And in some jurisdictions nonprofits provide alternative dispute resolution through 
grants. In Sacramento, for example, mediation is available through a California Lawyers for the 
Arts program that is paid for by the City of Sacramento’s COVID Relief f unding. Dispute 
resolution services under that program are voluntary, are available at no cost while funding is available, and include mediation relating to (1) negotiating repayment plans, (2) discussing rent 
and future tenancy, (3)  negotiating lease terms, (4)  seeking an alternative option to legal 
processes for tenancy and leases, and (4)  resolving other COVID- 19–related disagreements and 
needs for facilitated conversation.
97 
Opportunities and Considerations for Implementation  
Most eviction diversion programs use specially trained, neutral mediators. Many programs also include a range of ancillary services, such as legal representation, housing counseling, nonlegal housing assistance and advocacy, financial counseling, and rental assistance.
98 The work group 
During the  March 2020  State of the Judiciary address,  the Chief Justice asked if the judicial 
branch T emporary Assigned Judges Program could be used to advance efforts respond ing 
to homelessness. The answer is yes. Courts may request temporary judges  to backfill 
unlawful detainer calendars, serve as unlawful detainer settlement judges, or handle the  
court calendar of a  judicial officer who is otherwise needed to establish or expand a 
homeless court or other collaborative court program. The Judicial Council could also 
explore whether opportunities exist for courts to use the Temporary Assigned Judges 
Program to pursue the various other recommendations included in this report . Action Areas and Recommendations  
15 recomm ends that courts consider these models in developing and implementing their program s. 
For postfiling alternative dispute resolution, including mandatory settlement conferences, courts 
might consider the T emporary A ssigned J udges P rogram , reciprocal assignm ents, or other 
available neutrals  to assist with coverage.  
For both prefiling and postfiling alternative dispute resolution, courts might consider the advances in online dispute resolution (ODR). For example, for unlawful detainer and small claims proceedi ngs, the Superior Court of Los Angeles County launched an ODR program that 
brings parties together online in an effort to resolve their disputes. If the matter does not initially resolve, it can be trans itioned  to a county- provided online mediator, and if successful, a 
settlement or dismissal would be electronically filed with the court.  
Appropriate Judicial Council advisory bodies  such a s the Civil and Small Claims Advisory 
Committee or the Advisory Committee on Providing Access and Fairness  and staff shou ld 
identify existing prefiling eviction diversion and postfiling alternative dispute resolution programs, both in California and nationally, that could serve as models or learning sites to assist courts in implementing their programs. The Judicial Council Legislation Committee, Government al Affairs office, and Legal Services office should also review statutory deadlines 
related to unlawful detainer proceedings to determine if there is a need to pursue new legislation or changes to existing legislation.  
Recommendation 1.3.  Increase remote access and resources for self -help 
centers, designate self -help centers as a resource for unrepresented unlawful 
detainer litigants to access counsel , and prioritize development of more 
user -friendly unlawful detainer court forms with information sheets and 
checklists.  
Unrepresented litigants often lack access to resources for  assist ance in understanding unlawful 
detainer procedures and court forms. Although this report recommends the provision of counsel for all unlawful detainer litigants who cannot afford an attorney, the need for self -help services, 
such as whe n an individual seeks information before counsel is provided, will remain . 
Resources that  help litigants in unlawful detainer proceedings understand procedures, access 
counsel, and complete court forms would help landlords and tenants achieve better outcom es and 
promote housing stability. 
To improve court user experiences and outcomes in unlawful detainer proceedings, the Work 
Group on Homelessness recommends  the following : 
1. The Judicial Council should increase remote access to, and resources for, self -help 
centers and consider the SHARP Tech Connect model.  
2. The Judicial Council should prioritize the development of more user -friendly unlawful 
detainer court forms, information sheets, checklists, and infographics to better guide court users through the unlawful detainer process.
99 Action Areas and Recommendations  
16 3. Courts should designate self -help centers as a resource for unrepresented unlawful 
detainer litigants to access court -appointed or retained counsel.  
Background  
Courts operate self -help centers as a service for court users and typically provide in -person 
assistance at or near a courthouse. A managing attorney oversees well -trained staff who cannot 
give legal advice but can nevertheless provide information on how courts can help individuals in 
various subject areas, such as protection against abuse and harassment, name changes, and 
initiation of  or response to an unlawful detainer or a small claims case. Staff may help court 
users access needed forms and may offer information and resources, including written guides, to help court users better understand terminology, processes, and options for a particular area of the law. Staff may also make referrals to legal aid and lawyer referral services for full or partial 
representation  and could help court users access court -appointed counsel  if Recommendation 1.1 
is adopted and implemented.  
SHARP (Self -Help Assistance and Referral Program) is a court -supported program that provides 
free assistance to self -represented litigants through, among other things, phone and email 
communication, workshops, computer labs, informational videos, and referrals. As part of the Court Innovations Grant Program , established under the Budget Act of 2016 (Assem. Bill 1623; 
Stats. 2016, ch. 318), an initiative called SHARP Tech Connect was developed to expand the 
availability of SHARP services and reach more people by enabling remote access to self -help 
assistance in 22 counties.
100 The initiative promotes the use of document assembly programs, 
staff training, workshops, and improvements in technology infrastructure and broadband access to permit enhanced remote services.  
Certain Judicial Council forms are required or available in unlawful detainer proceedings, such as a mandatory summons form ( form SUM -130), an optiona l complaint form ( form UD -100), 
and an optional answer form ( form UD -105). The California Courts website posts general 
information about the unlawful detainer process and offers downloadable unlawful detainer court forms and pleadings.
101 The Judicial Counc il has partnered with the nonprofit organization Pro 
Bono Net to develop a document assembly template , created in HotDocs ,102 that allows  staff of 
self-help centers to assist unrepresented litigants in filling out the unlawful detainer forms.103 
The unlawful detainer HotDocs program is also directly available to self -represented litigants in 
some counties.104 Several courts have similarly used the Odyssey Guide & File program from 
Tyler Technologies, Inc. , to assist tenants in filing the optional answer form.105 
Rationale for t he Recommendations  
Improving self- help centers and court forms would help court users achieve better outcomes, 
which could stabilize housing and reduce homelessness. Improvements could also increase access to justice for court users affected by systemic disparities or language barriers.  
Self-help centers assist tenants and landlords in understanding their rights and responsibilities 
and in preparing court forms and required notices. In some courts, self -help centers also provide 
settlement services to assist litigants in resolving their housing dispute s. To facilitate eviction Action Areas and Recommendations  
17 diversion, courts should use their self -help centers to make information available to both 
landlords and tenants for assistance in resolving habitability, rent, and other matters without a 
complaint or an eviction judgment. Self -help centers should be prominently located at or near 
court fa cilities where unlawful detainer cases are heard.  
Before  the COVID- 19 pandemic, the number of unlawful detainer litigants seeking self -help 
assistance had been increasing,106 with a peak in 2019 when self -help centers assisted tenants 
16,849 times and landl ords 12,832 times.107 The work group anticipates  that requests for 
assistance will increase with the lifting of eviction moratoriums.108 
Unlawful detainer forms are complex and difficult. T hese forms, which are accurate from a legal 
perspective, use legal te rms that are unlikely to be understood by most self -represented litigants , 
which can lead to rejected filings and default judgments. For instance, the mandatory summons 
form (form SUM -130) indicates that the tenant has five court days from the date of serv ice to file 
a written response to the complaint. Tenants have expressed confusion regarding the deadline, focusing on the court’s file -stamped date in the upper right- hand corner even though the date of 
service may have been different. Clearly identifying the controlling date on the summons would be helpful.
109 Additionally, the optional answer form ( form UD- 105) has boxes for checking 
different types of denials and numerous defenses but does not make clear that litigants may be barred from making contention s or presenting defenses at trial based on the checked and 
unchecked boxes. 
The Judicial Council should make unlawful detainer proceedings more understandable. At least 
one study found that applying readability principles to Judicial Council court forms si gnificantly 
increased user comprehension.
110 Key features of readability include an appropriate reading 
grade level, language that is largely familiar to the reader or adequately explained, active voice, visual features that make the text highly readable, g raphics to support the key message of the 
text, intuitive ordering and integration of information, and consideration of end- user comments 
from field testing.
111 The Judicial Council should also consult a readability expert to ensure that 
the current font si ze is adequate for seniors and people  with impaired vision. In addition, the 
council should give a ttention to maintaining the forms at a reasonable length.  
Development of easy -to-follow information sheets, checklists, and infographics would also assist 
lay understanding of the process and compliance with procedural requirements, resulting in 
better outcomes for unrepresented litigants.  
Fiscal Impact  
Historically the Judicial Council has promoted funding for self -help centers as a budget priority. 
Statewide funding for self -help services was dramatically increased in 2018 from $11.2 million 
to $30.3 million.112 The Judicial Council is requesting that funding for self -help services be 
increased by $22 million for f iscal year  (FY)  2022–23. If approved, the  increased funding would 
provide for a staff attorney at the Judicial Council to develop information on statewide housing resources and to assist in the development of simplified forms.
113 Action Areas and Recommendations  
18 Improving court forms falls within the scope of the Judicial Council ’s regular responsibilities. 
But the c ouncil does not have dedicated funding for some aspects of the recommended unlawful 
detainer form improvements, such as funding for a readability specialist to aid in simplifying 
forms or for field tests of the revised  forms. Thus, the council should seek additional resources  
for these purposes. Improving forms will also affect  the workload of the Civil and Small Claims 
Advisory Committee . 
Opportunities and Considerations for Implementation  
Although the work group has r eceived differing opinions on the subject, courts may see a deluge 
of unlawful detainer filings after the COVID -19 eviction moratoriums have lifted. Given that 
most tenants in unlawful detainer actions are currently unrepresented, and that serious conseque nces may result from their failure to understand the process and how to preserve their 
rights, the Judicial Council should seek additional funding from the Legislature to further expand 
and fund self -help centers to accommodate increased capacities for bot h in-person and remote 
self-help services. As part of this effort, each court should evaluate whether its  in-person or 
remote self- help services and centers provide adequate and effective access, and whether staffing 
and other resources should be increased to meet greater demand.  
Additionally, t he Judicial Council should prioritize the improvement of unlawful detainer forms 
as an immediate need . Even though improvement efforts will impose an additional workload on 
Civil and Small Claims Advisory Committee m embers and staff , among others , the work group 
believes that the benefits of undertaking this work justify such effort.  
Information sheets and checklists should be developed using language that assists self -
represented litigants in understanding the inform ation requested in unlawful detainer court forms. 
Infographics could be created to visually orient litigants about where they are in the unlawful detainer process and what outcomes may occur based on their actions or inactions. Among other things, these resources should explain (1)  the importance of filing a complaint that conforms to 
statutory requirements; (2) the importance of filing an answer within the five -day deadline; 
(3) the potential consequences of filing no answer a nd defaulting; (4)  the potential consequences 
of ignoring or providing incomplete responses to discovery requests; and (5)  the process for 
requesting a stay of execution after an adverse judgment is entered.  
The Judicial Council should also consider develo ping a court form for a settlement and order in 
an unlawful detainer action. Such a form should include all the key elements of a typical unlawful detainer settlement (such as sealing the file, an opportunity to cure default, and payment or waiver of other  amounts , including attorney fees and costs) and also provide a 
mechanism for judgment to be entered only in the event of a default on the settlement. The currently available tool, Stipulation for Entry of Judgment  (form UD -115), is not easily modified 
to reflect a settlement without a judgment . As indicated, a settlement that avoids a judgment is an 
important  goal for most tenants.  Action Areas and Recommendations  
19 The Judicial Council Advisory Committee on Providing Access and Fairness and the Civil and 
Small Claims Advisory Committee are well positioned to oversee the implementation of this 
recommendation.  
Action Area 2: Reduce barriers to housing,  and help identify 
housing resources.  
California has more than 4 50 collaborative courts and homeless courts that already do much to 
provide rehabilitation services  and housing for individuals in need . Eight in 10 participants ha ve 
improved outcomes after entering such programs.114 
Collaborative courts often rely on a team- based approach in which justice system partners —
including judges, court staff, prosecuting and defense attorneys, treatment providers, social workers, probation staff, and others —work together to address the underlying issues that lead 
individuals to become involved in the justice system. Existing types of collaborative courts include adult and juvenile drug courts, dependency drug courts, reentry courts, mental health 
courts, behavioral health courts, mandatory supervision courts, veterans treatment courts, driving 
under the influence (DUI) courts, community courts, and homeless courts. Most collaborative 
courts entail ongoing judicial monitoring to ensure that individuals access treatment services and comply with supervision orders or other program mandates. Participants are often  in the se court 
programs for 12 to 18 months  or longer . 
Even though c ommunity courts and homeless 
courts are based on the collaborative court model , 
they tend to involve lower -level offenses with 
interventions that are much shorter in duration. Homeless court programs recognize the voluntary efforts of participants to  improve their lives and 
move from the streets toward self -sufficiency  
through community -based treatment or services. 
For participants who complete appropriate treatment or services, the homeless court will dismiss or reduce their charges and clear outstanding fines and fees. 
Collaborative court and homeless court programs have the ability to reduce barriers to housing and to help participants access housing resources.  Homeless courts are patterned after Stand Down courts, which for  years have 
successfully provided opportunities for veterans experiencing homelessness, mental health issues, and substance abuse to receive services to address their needs.  
Stand Downs  are typically one- to three -
day events organized by c ommunity-
based veterans services organizations  and 
county veterans service s offices, and  in 
cooperation with the courts and a variety 
of state, federal, and private agencies. Veterans can have multiple court cases adjudicated during these events. Court cases generally are attached to lower -
level crimes and infractions that can affect their ability to drive or to find housing or employment.
 Action Areas and Recommendations  
20 Recommendation 2.1. Establish a h omeless court program in more counties to 
reduce  barrier s to housing stability by clearing fines, fees , warrants, and 
outstanding cases after  treatment and rehabilitation.  
Homeless c ourt programs offer treatment and rehabilitation in the community rather than 
incarceration in jail and allow  participants to reso lve citations and low-level cases often resulting 
from conditions of homelessness and poverty. When treatment and rehabilitation are  complete, 
and charges and fines are resolved , barriers to housing and employment are reduced.  
To maximize the impact of these programs, the Work Group on Homelessness recommends  the 
following : 
1. Courts in more jurisdictions should establish homeless court program s to re duce  barriers 
to housing stability by clearing fines, fee s, warrants, and outstanding cases after treatme nt 
and rehabilitation.  
2. Courts should ensure that their homeless c ourt eligibility criteria are  as expansive as 
feasible and should include cases involving higher -level offenses, when appropriate . 
Background  
A homeless court program is designed to addres s the specific circumstances and needs of court 
users who are experiencing or are at risk of experiencing homelessness . The program uses an 
action -first model that requires participants to achieve individualized treatment, rehabilitation, or 
other goals before appear ing in homeless court.115 Homeless c ourts are often  convened once a 
month, and participants resolve their legal issues or cases in a single court appearan ce. The 
Superior Court of San Diego County introduced the first homeless c ourt program in 1989 during 
the County of San Diego Stand Down, an event designed to provide services to veterans 
experiencing homelessness, and the county thereafter expanded the pr ogram to reach beyond the 
veteran community.116 The American Bar Association (ABA) has adopted the  San Diego 
Homeless Court model as a promising practice, and it is used as an example  for courts around the 
country.117 
Rationale for t he Recommendation  
The hom eless court program  is a vital intervention that reduces barriers t o housing stability by 
(1) dismissing or reducing charges, fines, and fees, particularly where there is a relationship 
between conditions of homelessness and the charged offenses ; or (2)  ordering postconviction 
relief, such as expungement  of criminal records , in circumstances where court intervention 
would appropriately reduce or remove collateral consequences that may create or deepen homelessness. But c ourts offering a  homeless court  program  often limit eligibility criteria . Courts 
should consider broad application of the program by expanding eligibility beyond infractions, 
warrants, and low -level misdemeanors to include , when appropriate, higher -level offenses.  
Costs to Implement  
The homeless court program is recognized  as a cost -effective model, with savings to the court  
exceeding court  costs in operating the program. The cost  savings are expressed through the Action Areas and Recommendations  
21 reduction of continued court and criminal justice involvement with  prog ram participants and 
reflected across the criminal justice continuum by the avoidance of  incarceration. For example, 
each participant appearing in the San Diego Homeless Court often has multiple pending cases. 
The program allows the court to save time and reduce overall court costs by avoiding extended prosecution and litigation. R ather than requiring the court  to prepare for and hold multiple 
hearings , cases can be resolved in bulk and all  at once. The program also eliminates the need for 
the court to administratively track and pursue collection of fines and fees  from individuals who 
can ill afford to pay them .
118 
The work group anticipates that the homeless court program costs will  minimal ly affect  the 
court’s general operating funds. The homeless court program leverages existing resources and 
services that are provided by partnering agencies, and courts assume modest administrative costs associated with the homeless court  calendar, such as the cost of staff time. The work group 
encourages c ourts to pursue available outside funding to supplant these costs, such as applicable 
grants administered by the Judicial Council or competitive grants offered through state and federal funding agencies. 
Opportunities and Considerations for Implementation  
A homeless court program can benefit from a multidisciplinary approach and should involve 
collaborations between the courts, local homelessness outreach programs, community -based 
providers, criminal justic e partners, or other county agencies. The ABA has recognize d that a 
homeless court program can combine an action -first model with plea bargain systems and 
alternative sentencing structures to address various offenses.
119 
Potential b arriers to implementing a new—or expanding an existing— homeless court program  
include  (1) the capacity limitations of service providers ;120 (2) the lack of appropriate service 
providers, particularly for small or rural jurisdictions where providers may be inaccessible or 
nonexistent; and (3)  limited or no buy -in from local justice stakeholders, such as local 
prosecuting agencies or the defense bar . Counties experiencing  or anticipating these barriers may 
consider collaborating with local probation departments, public or behavioral health agencies, or 
other county agencies that interface with people experiencing homelessness to develop a locally responsive program that achieves outcomes similar to those of the traditional homeless court  
model.  
Another consideration for implementing or  expanding a  homeless court program  is to decid e 
how the program will convene. Homeless court programs have traditiona lly been conducted in 
person at courthouses or at community locations such as homeless shelters. But during the COVID- 19 pandemic , many homeless court program s hav e operated remotely through video or 
telephone proceedings.
121 As the judicial branch prepares for operations after the pandemic , 
courts and the Judicial Council should, consistent with Recommendation 3.1, maintain an option 
for remote appearances in homeless court program s. 
To assist with homeless court program  expansion, the Judicial Council has contracted with the 
ABA Commission on Homelessness and Poverty to provide training and technical assistance to Action Areas and Recommendations  
22 courts , with the goal of strengthening the homeless court  model throughout California. The effort 
so far includes at least 10 counties interested in starting a new program. Existing homeless court 
program s will receive technical assistance to increase  service capacity and  provide an option for 
remote services. Individualized technical assistance, including a cus tomized homeless court  
toolkit, will be developed for all interested counties. All courts should take advantage of this  
opportunity to launch a new homeless court program or expand an existing one . 
The Collaborative Justice Courts Advisory Committee, with assistance as needed from the 
Judicial Council staff overseeing the contract with the ABA Commission on Homelessness and 
Poverty, is well positioned to oversee the implementation of this recommendation.  
Recommendation 2.2. Benefit from economies of scale by increasing the funding 
and caseload capacity for existing collaborative courts,  ensure that the largest 
number of cases possible are processed through collaborative courts, and implement new collaborative court programs in appropriate jurisdictions.  
Collaborative courts are recognized as effective interventions that address cases involving people 
with behavioral health issues, many of whom experience homelessness or are housing insecure. 
These programs promote accountability by combining judicial supervis ion with rigorously 
monitored rehabilitation services and treatment in lieu of incarceration . Collaborative courts 
provide opportunities for the courts to support the housing needs and stability of participants and 
should be expanded throughout the state.  
To maximize the impact of collaborative courts, the Work Group on Homelessness recommends  
the following : 
1. Collaborative courts should be expanded throughout the state by increasing the funding and caseload capacity  of existing programs.  Courts should ens ure that their collaborative  
court eligibility criteria are as expansive as feasible to enable as many appropriate cases 
as possible to be processed through the collaborative court programs . 
2. Courts should implement new collaborative court programs in appropriate jurisdictions.  
Background  
Collaborative courts use a problem- solving and multidisciplinary approach to address the 
underlying issues that le ad participants to become involved in the justice system. Drug courts ar e 
the longest running and most prolific type of collaborative court and have been heavily researched. Studies of these courts demonstrate their effectiveness in improving participant outcomes and reducing recidivism.
122 Similarly, s tudies on mental health c ourts,123 DUI 
courts,124 and reentry courts125 have shown that these court models are effective in reducing 
recidivism and substance use.  Although t he body of research for  other types of collaborative 
courts is less extensive, most of those other court types are based on the drug court model.  Action Areas and Recommendations  
23 Rationale for t he Recommendation  
Research suggests that a significant percentage of collaborative court participants experience or 
are at risk of experiencing homelessness. A point -in-time count of the San Diego County 
Mandatory Supervision Court, for instance, indicated that 63 percent of participants were 
housing insecure, with 33 percent experiencing homelessness and 30 percent having unstable housing. The standards described in the national Adult Drug Court Best Practi ce Standards , as 
established by the National Association of Drug Court Professionals, identify  housing as a key 
complementary service to aid in treatment and program compliance , with  many collaborative 
court programs arranging for residential treatment or housing for participants.
126 
The presence of substance use, mental health disorders, and co-occurring disorders is identified 
as both a cause and an effect of homelessness.127 Integrated responses to behavioral health needs 
and homelessness are essential, particularly for people who become involved in the criminal justice system. Collaborative court teams have extensive experience in collaborating with service 
and treatment providers to identify and address these multifactorial needs and generally have 
systems in place to refer participants to housing and other services.  Many participants who en ter 
collaborative courts can gain access to residential treatment and housing , though r esearch on the 
long- term impact of collaborative court participation on housing status is lacking .
128 
Despite the proliferation of collaborative courts, caseload sizes tend to be low er than what they 
could be  across jurisdictions. Low caseload size often gives rise to the mis conception that 
collaborative courts are “ boutique courts ” that can service only a small number of people and 
therefore have  little overall effect on the justice system. But with increased personnel and 
resources, collaborative courts can increase caseload capacities and have a far -reaching impact, 
and the judicial branch can benefit from economies of scale.129 
Costs to Implement  
The Judicial Council sponsored a study of nine adult drug courts in California and found an 
average net savings benefit of $11,000 per participant .130 Other studies show similar results.131 
Collaborative courts require dedicated court investment to provide conce ntrated staff time , and 
such investment may include costs to supplement services rendered by justice system partners. 
Although collaborative courts are proven to be cost -effective, dedicated funding must be 
provided to enable courts to expand caseload size s. Grant programs have been important 
resources for courts in supporting collaborative court operations , and the work group encourages 
courts to pursue applicable grants administered by the Judicial Council and  competitive grants 
offered through state and federal funding agencies .  Nevertheless, as helpful as grant programs 
can be for collaborative courts, program expansion will require funding stability. The judicial 
branch is seeking additional  state funding to support court -related functions for collaborative 
courts. If funding becomes available, the Judicial Council should develop a program for data collection, training, and technical assistance to support the continued use  and expansion of 
collaborative court programs.  Action Areas and Recommendations  
24 Opportunities  and Considerations for Implementation  
All courts with existing collaborative court programs should evaluate program eligibility 
criteria —as well as outreach, referral , and screening processes —to allow for maximum 
participation. Several courts have successfully implemented wide- scale, high- volume 
collaborative court programs, such as the San Diego County Mandatory Supervision Court and the San Joaquin County DUI Court. These programs use needs assessment s and screeni ng 
processes to tailor program placements to each participant’ s recidivism risks and treatment 
needs, ensuring that resources —including housing—are properly focused on people  who have 
the highest risks and needs. The work group recommends extending this practice to all new and 
existing collaborative court programs.
132 
To assist all collaborative court models, the Collaborative Justice Courts Advisory Committee should continue to pursu e funding through budget change proposal s
133 or other available 
processes to  support court -related functions for collaborative courts. The advisory committee 
should also seek funding for the development and implementation of training and outreach 
initiatives focused on expansion of caseload s and caseload capacity . 
Recommendation 2.3. Prioritize the creation and implementation of long -range 
plans for housing security for youth and nonminor dependents involved in the 
foster care system . 
Housing placement and homelessness prevention are essential needs that must be add ressed for 
youth aging out of the foster care system and nonminor dependents involved  in the extended 
foster care program.134 Dependency courts hear cases in which minors  are removed from their 
home s because of  abuse or neglect and  address their immediate n eeds during regular review 
hearings ; however, the impact of homelessness and housing insecurity on youth formerly 
involved in the foster care system is  so significant that long- term housing plans should receive 
increased, specific focus.  
To better support youth involved in the foster care system, the Work Group on Homelessness 
recommends  the following : 
1. Courts should establish specialized calendars to assist judicial officers in focusing on long- range housing planning for youth and nonminor dependents . 
2. The Judicial Council should review and amend California Rules of Court, applicable Judicial Council forms, and information charts as necessary to ensure a focus on the immediate and long- range housing needs of youth and nonminor dependents . 
Background  
Notable research illuminates the nexus between involvement with the foster care system and 
homelessness. According to the Briefing on Youth Homelessness 2020, a report by Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, aging out of the foster care system is a driver of youth homelessness. The report found that 25 percent of the adults and 8 percent of the youth experiencing homelessness in the County of Los Angeles have a history of foster care Action Areas and Recommendations  
25 placement.135 Similarly, California Youth Transitions to Adulthood Study  (CalYOUTH ), a study 
conducted by Chapin Hall at the University of Chicago, found that one  in four  foster youth had at 
least one night of homelessness in the past two years, and 30 percent couch surfed—stay ed with 
friends or relatives on a t emporary basis —because they had nowhere  else to go.136 These 
findings are consistent with national statistics that suggest one in four  youth will experience 
homelessness within four years of aging out of the foster care system.137 
Effective January 2012,138 California implemented a voluntary extended foster care program 
allowing eligible nonminor dependents  to work with social workers or probation officers to  
creat e a case plan while residing in an eligible placement.139 Nonminor dependents  participating 
in the extended foster care program can exit at any time and, if they change their mind, can 
petition the court to reenter the program.140 For youth who opted out of the extended foster care 
program, about 45 percent experience d homelessness whether or not they  reentered the 
program .141 Homelessness is  more common among participants coming from congregate care 
setting s, and more common for  participants who identif y as male or as  LGBTQIA+.142 
Even with the extended foster care program, about 20 percent of youth aging out of the foster 
care system experience homelessness.143 The impact of homelessness and housing insecurity on 
youth aging out of the foster care system and nonminor dependents  in the extended foster care 
program is significant, and courts shoul d establish specialized calendars to make a conscious 
effort to focus on long- range housing planning for these individuals . 
The extended foster care program  has, nevertheless, shown significant benefits. The CalYOUTH  
study concluded that each year a youth spends in the extended foster care program reduces the risk of homelessness by 23 percent and reduces the risk of arrest by 28 percent.
144 
Rationale for t he Recommendation  
Minors who have never been involved in the child welfare system are more likely to have a support system that assist s them with housing, housing expenses, and transitioning to  becoming 
self-supporting adults. But when the state and the juvenile court determine that minors  need to be 
removed from their families , the minors enter into the ca re of the court and the foster care 
system . Courts should assure, insofar as possible, that the transition from court care to 
independence does not result in homelessness.  
For this recommendation, the w ork group interviewed a number of experts, including j udicial 
officers handling review hearings and specialized calendars involving youth aging out of the foster care system and nonminor dependents  in the extended foster care program. Notably, the  
judicial officers who spoke of the  care and passion they br ing to their assignment also viewed the  
courts as having a moral responsibility to ensure that youth and nonminor dependents  exiting the 
foster care system have the necessary tools and structures in place to be appropriately housed. 
Standard 5.40(e)(9) of the  California Standards of Judicial Administration specifically requires 
that juvenile dependency judge s “[e]ncourage the development of community services and 
resources to assist homeless, truant, runaway, and incorrigible children.” These cases are Action Areas and Recommendations  
26 complex and involve many  overlapping agency responsibilities. Judges, especially dependency 
court judges, are required to enforce the delivery of specific services, and they must hold 
responsible agencies and service providers accountable to ensure that resources are in place to 
properly house  youth exiting the foster care system.  
Most foster youth have few, if any, resources for assistance. Many housing programs for youth 
formerly in the foster care system have significant waitlists , and youth who  are not placed on the 
waitlist in time may age out of the extended foster care program before housing becomes available. Moreover, youth preparing to exit the foster care system and juvenile court jurisdiction often need assistance in obtain ing the documentation ne cessary for housing rea diness , such as in 
applying for identification cards , driver ’s licenses, and s ocial security c ards.
145 The need for 
active support is particularly acute for youth who have physical, medical, mental health, or developmental needs that make self -advocacy diff icult.  Thus, court p lanning should extend 
beyond simply providing a list of locally available housing programs and should include focused assistance in navigating systems, getting  placed on waitlists, and creating a plan in which the 
court and youth can ha ve confidence.  Without adequate planning, youth may  experience 
homelessness when they leave the foster care system.  
There are  myriad housing opportunities, including programs  expressly targeted at  youth currently 
or formerly involved in the foster care sys tem. But a ccessing these programs frequently require s 
a significant amount of effort and ability  on the part of both judicial officers and the youth 
involved. Judicial officers need to have the time and resources to (1)  develop the expertise to 
understand these options, (2) encourage the agencies involved with the youth to focus on this 
issue, and (3) create a robust plan for housing once the youth is no longer involved in the 
dependency system.  
Costs to Implement  
The Judicial Council uses  a workload -based funding model to determine funding allocat ions for 
each court.  Once funded, trial courts have discretion on how to allocate and spend the funding. 
Specialized calendars may not be necessary  for counties with a small fost er youth population. 
But f or counties with a large foster youth population, courts should evaluate resources and 
supplement, as necessary,  with backfill resources, such as the Temporary Assigned Judges 
Program.  
Opportunities and Considerations for Implemen tation  
Dependency cases are complex and involve a large number of overlapping agency responsibilities. Having a knowledgeable judge to assist youth and nonminor dependents  with 
navigating the transition out of the foster care system is imperative for addre ssing  homelessness 
of transitional- aged youth. Although t he Judicial Council offers various  tools and resources to 
assist in judicial compliance  with the California Rules of Court governing nonminor dependents , 
the council  should consider whether additiona l measures, such as development of appropriate 
bench cards or revisi ons to court  rules regarding nonminor dependents , would be beneficial.  Action Areas and Recommendations  
27 Dependency cases involve an extensive number  of Judicial Council forms , most of which  have 
boxes to check that certai n items have been accomplished . Although housing is frequently listed 
as one box among many to check, highlight ing the need for future housing planning would be 
helpful. For instance, forms could be revised to list housing as a specific stand -alone item. C ourts 
could also require reporting  agencies to specify the specific housing plan for a youth once 
dependency court jurisdiction ends.  
The Judicial Council Family and Juvenile Law Advisory Committee, with support as needed 
from the Collaborative Justice Courts Advisory Committee, is well suited to provide 
implementation oversight for this recommendation , including, as necessary, efforts to adopt or 
modify the California Rules of Court and applicable Judicial Council forms to ensure that court 
processes and procedures are designed to reduce  homelessness as youth and nonminor 
dependents  exit juvenile court jurisdiction  and the foster care system . Work group staff can assist 
the advisory committee by identifying the small, medium, and la rge courts that have successfully 
implemented specialized calendars focused on youth and nonminor dependents  aging out of the 
foster care and extended foster care program s. 
Recommendation 2.4. Arrange for h ousing resource navigators at or near 
courthouses to provide resources to court users experiencing or at risk of 
experiencing homelessness.  
Courts across the state have reported an increased number of court users facing housing 
instability. Having an available and accessible housing resource navigator pro gram provides an 
opportunity for the court to assist users with connections to local housing resources.  
To assist court users in connecting with housing resources, the W ork G roup on Homelessness 
recommends  the following : 
• Courts should arrange for housing r esource navigator s at or near courthouse s to provide 
resources to court users experiencing or at risk of experiencing homelessness.  
Background  
Some courts partner with county and local service providers who serve as “housing resource 
navigators” for court users in need. Stationed at or near the courthouse, knowledgeable providers link court users to available services in their communities. Housing re source navigators typically 
are not attorneys and are not employed by the court, but they are  trained to screen people for risk 
of homelessness and to identify housing and related service needs.
146 Housing resource 
navigators often operate physically within  a courthouse, enabling them to provide direct , person -
to-person assistance when connecting court users to available services.147 
Rationale for the Recommendation  
Providing a link to housing resources at or near the courthouse is useful for court users across 
case types. The nexus between homelessness and the criminal justice population is well documented,
148 and California courts have reported an increased number of court users , 
including tenants  in residential evictions, who are facing housing instabili ty. Action Areas and Recommendations  
28 Although criminal defense or other attorneys may have an opportunity to identify the social 
needs of their clients, such as the need for housing or treatment, their ability to obtain assistance 
can be limited. A housing navigator could help address  such needs . 
The Housing First model in homeless ness services  posits  that a person cannot turn their life 
around or benefit from other assistance unless they are first provided with housing. And helping court users obtain housing could reduc e their recidivism and help them receive other needed 
services. As changes in California law increasingly favor services and treatment rather than 
incarceration , courts must be able to connect court users to housing and other community  
resources.

Many people who appear in court, especially for misdemeanor c harge s, have experience  with 
substance use and addiction, mental illness, and housing insecurity. Moreover, a substantial number of the minor offenses handled in misdemeanor courts —such as petty theft, possession of 
a shopping cart, unlawful recycling , and public  drunkenness —are directly related to a lack of 
housing. Persons  charged with misdemeanor offenses, if convicted, generally do not receive the 
resources available in felony ca ses, where resources to address housing and other needs may be 
offered as part of supervised probation or parole. In addition to misdemeanor and unlawful 
detainer matters, court users in family law and other cases may experience housing insecurity. Having a housing resource navigator  available at or near the courthouse would enable court users 
to be linked to local services (and a homeless court program , if available) that may improve their 
circumstances and reduce future court involvement. 
Costs to Implement  
Courts that make physical space available for navigators may assume nominal facility costs that 
should not  exceed the typical costs of maintaining the space for existing court purposes. 
Opportunities and Considerations for Implementation  
Implementation of a housing navigator program typically  require s collaborative efforts between 
the court and the local community, such as  county or nonprofit agencies that provide housing and 
related services. By leveraging a variety of resources, such  partnerships  may m aximize benefits 
for court navigator  program s as well as for providers of homelessness services.  
For courts that lack  adequate courthouse space to station a housing navigator  program or that 
have concerns about increasing nonessential court traffic if walk -in services are allowed , courts 
should explore opportunities to use  nearby locations or to develop partnerships with providers 
located near the courthouse to ensure that court users can reasonably access the program.  
Recommendation 2.5. Ensure that courts can remove a record of conviction in a 
more timely and efficient manner.  
A criminal record presents a significant challenge to a person seeking affordable housing and 
correlate s with deepening poverty and long- term homelessness.
150 The judicial branch should 
ensure that courts can prioritize the process of appropriately removing records of c onvictions  in a 
more timely and efficient manner. The most effective way to do so is by improving the Action Areas and Recommendations  
29 processing of  bulk data across platforms  to scale authorized record clearance and reduce 
instances of discrimination in housing and employment against people  who have criminal 
histories.  
To assist the Judicial Council and the courts in processing record clearances, the Work Group on 
Home lessness recommends the following : 
1. The Judicial Council should work with the California Department of Justice, the Legislature, and other necessary stakeholders to develop proper supports and infrastructures to ensure that bulk data provided to the cour ts are in a format that is 
accessible for processing.  
2. Trial courts should collaborate locally with prosecutors, public defenders, technology professionals, and other appropriate stakeholders to ensure responsiveness to expedited record relief initiative s, particularly those involving automatic record relief.  
Background  
Black  individuals  are disproportionately arrest ed and c onvict ed in California. In 2016, Black 
individuals represent ed approximately 6 percent of California’s population but were involved in 
16 percent of all California arrests .
151 Black and Hispanic  people are overrepresented in pending 
felony cases.152 These disparit ies are reflected in a disproportionate number of convictions  on an 
individual’s criminal record ,153 mak ing homelessness more likely.  
Clearing a criminal record in appropriate circumstances can further the interests of justice and 
improve housing and employment outcomes . In certain situations, a conviction may be reduced 
from a felony to a misdemeanor. L egislation has addressed circumstances for automatic 
processing of record relief in bulk, seeking to alleviat e the need for individuals to petition the 
court for relief . The current data exchange system infrastructure , however, is insufficient for 
efficient bu lk process ing of  record relief cases . 
Rationale for the Recommendation  
In 2018 and 2019, the Legislature passed two significant automat ic record relief bills —Assembly 
Bill 1793 (Stats. 2018, ch. 993) and Assembly Bill 1076 (Stats. 2019, ch. 578)—that made it the 
responsibility of government agencies  to effectuate conviction record removal . Before  the 
enactment  of those bills, legislation authorizing relief from criminal convictions required people 
to petition the courts for this benefit. For example, the 2016 passage of Proposition 64, the Adult 
Use of Marijuana Act , authorized a process in which people could petition the courts to have 
convictions removed from their records. Although many public defenders and nonprofit organizations devoted resources before  the COVID- 19 pandemic to encourage the petition 
process, only  a small number  of petitions was filed . There w ere also difficult ies in processing  
and sending the information to the California Department of Justice (DOJ).
154 Action Areas and Recommendations  
30 Although an automatic record clearance 
process is less burdensome for people  with 
eligible convictions, it has  multiple 
challenges, including the lack of reliable data, antiquated data management systems that cannot adequately support bulk data manipulation, and the inability to efficient ly match cases and people across 
data systems. Lessons learned from AB 
1793 and AB 1076 indicate that addressing these challenges requires a significant amount of planning and collaboration between stakeholders at the state and local levels, as well as dat a infrastructure 
support and improvement. 
Costs to Implement  
Some funding has been provided in 
connection with record- relief legislation.  
Further automation promises to increase 
cost savings. Accepting support from nonprofit organizations with experience in data integration and manipulation  could be 
economically efficient  for courts . 
Opportunities and Considerations for Implementation  
Further p rioritizing effective conviction relief would reinforce the judicial branch’s commitment 
to justice by r educing barriers to housing and employment. The Judicial Council should continue 
to work with the DOJ,  the Legislature, and other necessary stakeholders to develop the proper 
infrastructure and support to ensure that bulk record clearance can be implemented effici ently 
and equitably throughout the state.  
Courts should coordinate regarding best practices in processing bulk data and integrating data 
with current case management systems. Specific discussions should take place with technology organizations to determine  where free support could be best utilized, and e ach court should 
research how best to interface with the DOJ. The Investigative Consumer Reporting Agencies Act (Civ. Code, § 1786 et  seq.) should also be reviewed to ensure that people obtaining 
automat ic relief are fully protected against the inappropriate disclosure of an arrest or conviction.  
The Judicial Council Technology Committee and the Information Technology Advisory Committee —in coordination with the  Trial Court Presiding Judges Advisory Committee, the 
Court Executives Advisory Committee , and other necessary advisory committees— are 
positioned to oversee implementation of this recommendation.  The authorized removal of conviction records is not the only way courts can assist individual s whose criminal history is 
a barrier to achieving housing stability. Recent laws allow courts to divert lower -
level offenders from the justice system before conviction. Criminal diversion programs allow individuals struggling with substance use disorders or mental illness to access treatment programs and, if the programs are successfully completed, to avoid incarceration or a record of conviction. Courts implementing these programs collaborate with various justice partners —including prosecutors, defense 
attorneys, and treatment providers —to 
ensure that appropriate candidates are identified and diverted. The United States Interagency Council on Homelessness considers criminal diversion a top strategy 
for ending homelessness.  Action Areas and Recommendations  
31 Action Area 3: Utilize technology and improve court 
procedures, communications, and information to increase 
access to justice for court users regardless of their housing 
circumstances . 
Chief Justice Cantil -Sakauye has long emphasized the importance of “ Access 3D ,” which refers 
to the concept that access to justice should be physical, remote, and equal. Physical a ccess 
includes the ability to physically enter a court building.155 Remote access entails expanding 
options for court users to conduct branch business online. Equal access contemplates  equal 
opportunity for people to receive the benefits of court programs and services; it means that courts 
should be available to everyone, regardless of their income level, housing status, race, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, language, medical or mental health condition, substance use, or prior traumatic experience.  
The following recommendations would actualize  the Chief Justice’s vision of  Access 3D  with 
the utilization of  technology to reduce barriers, increase access, improve communication, a nd 
expand information for court users who are without housing or are housing insecure.  
Recommendation 3.1. Increase access by providing an option for remote 
appearances.  
Courts have demonstrated that technology can assist court users who would otherwise ha ve 
difficulty accessing the courts and court resources . 
To assist the judicial branch in overcoming access 
barriers and maximizing equal access to justice, 
the Work Group on Home lessness recommends 
the following : 
1. The Judicial Council should increase 
access to the courts by providing an option 
for remote appearances.  
2. Courts should consider opportunities to establish mobile courts.  
Background  
People experiencing or at risk of experiencing 
homelessness require access to the court s for a 
variety of reasons , such as to respond to an 
eviction complaint, address a criminal charge, participate in a family law or juvenile court matter, or pay fines or fees.  Many are required to 
make a personal appearance at a courthouse . The Superior Court  of Placer County 
and the Placer County Probation 
Department  are developing a mobile 
court for homeless court participants. 
Using  a former library bookmobile 
outfitted with remote technology and 
staffed by the probation department, the mobile court will drive to where  
homeless court participants  are 
staying and help them conduct court 
business and connect to the homeless court by vide o. The mobile court is 
expected to improve access to the court and reduce the failure -to-
appear rate for th e homeless court 
calendar.
 Action Areas and Recommendations  
32 As indicated, transportation and other barriers often impede the ability of th ese court users to  
physically access court services. But many of them have access to a cell phone or  comput er. The 
option to appear remotely will continue to increase access to the courts . 
Rationale for t he Recommendation  
In 2017, the Commission on the Future of California’s Court System (Futures Commission) 
recommended, among other things, the development of a  pilot project “to allow remote 
appearances by parties, counsel, and witnesses for most noncriminal court proceedings.”156 The 
Futures Commission noted that no law at the time precluded appearances by remote video in noncriminal cases.
157 On March 4, 2020, G overnor Gavin Newsom issued a proclamation 
declaring a state of emergency pertaining to the COVID -19 pandemic. In response, the Judicial 
Council approved the Emergency Rules Related to COVID -19, including emergency rule 3, 
which authorizes the use of technology for remote appearances in both criminal and civil proceedings and which remains in place as of this writing.  
By its terms, emergency rule 3 will remain in effect until 90 days after the Governor lifts the state of emergency, or until the rule is amen ded or repealed by the Judicial Council . Under the 
emergency rule, courts are encouraged to conduct proceedings remotely, though criminal  court s 
must obtain consent  from the defendant  to do so. The emergency rule provides that remote 
proceedings include, but are not limited to, “the use of video, audio, and telephonic means for 
remote appearances; the electronic exchange and authentication of documentary evidence; e-filing and e -service; the use of remote interpreting; and the use of remote reporting and 
electronic recording to make the official record of an action or proceeding.”
158 
More recently, SB 241 added section 367.75 to the Code of Civil Procedure to authorize remote appearances and the use of remote technology in civil trials, hearings, co nferences, and 
proceedings, along with juvenile dependency proceedings, under certain circumstances, until July 2023.  
Since the advent of the pandemic, many courts have made great strides in utilizing technology to facilitate access to justice in various c ases. In the context of homeless court programs, a t least 
one court  regularly operates by telephone,
159 and others conduct their hearings by video 
conference.160 The Superior Court of Alameda County has been successfully helping to prevent 
homelessness by operating mandatory unlawful detainer settlement conferences via the BlueJeans video  conference platform or by telephone. And as part of many court programs, court 
users who  lack a personal internet connection or are unable to connect to a court video 
confer ence with their own mobile device have  been able to connect through collaborative 
arrangements with others , such as a library, attorney, justice partner, or service provider.
161 
Allowing these court users to appear remotely  increases their access to justice, and courts should 
continue to maintain this option.  
Some courts have had considerable success bringing in- person homeless court proceedings to a 
community location where  the participants are located ,162 and other  courts have sought to Action Areas and Recommendations  
33 establish “mobile courts,” which use a truck, bus , or van loaded with mobile technology and 
travel to a location to help participants connect remotely  to a court proceeding.163 
Costs to Implement  
The State Budget  has made funding available to the courts for technology modernization and 
language translation. The judicial b ranch received two years of modernization funding for FY s 
2020–21 and 2021–22 and is seeking ongoing permanent funding. Courts spent m uch of the 
funding for FY 2020–21 on the development and delivery of remote services, including services 
for remote appearances, virtual customer service centers, virtual self -help centers, and remote 
language access services . A key driver for the use of this funding is ensur ing equal access to 
court services for all Californians  by maximiz ing the types of access channels available to  court 
users. The Judicial Council should continue to seek funding for the  support of remote services, 
such as services for remote appearances, online customer service, electronic document assembly 
programs, mobile court services, and remote  access to case information.  
Opportunities and Considerations for Implementation  
Offering an option for remote appearances can ensure 
broader court access and uninterrupted service. Making this option available will require courts to use existing equipment and technology, including videoc onferencing 
platforms, or to acquire this equipment and technology if they are  not already in place. To the extent courts do not 
already have electronic technology options for court proceedings, the judicial branch has established a license for use of the Zoom Video Communications, Inc., platform, which trial courts can use to conduct video conferences. Courts can and should also collaborate with justice partners and service providers when such 
collaboration will provide greater opportunities for court users to connect with the courts. Remote arrangements 
with justice partners and service providers must include consideration of whether those partners and providers have sufficient technology and spaces to maintain an adequate remote connection.  
The ability for people across California to connect to the internet will serve the public and benefit those who have difficulty physically  accessing the courts. Providing people 
who are experiencing homelessness or who otherwise have limited internet access with the abi lity to connect is a 
priority for state and local governments and is particularly meaningful to the judicial branch in 
ensuring equal access to court services. The judicial branch has partnered with the executive branch on existing efforts to promote the e xpansion of broadband connectivity, including Court ordered fines and fees often 
present an insurmountable barrier 
for individuals with low -income, 
and when payment becomes delinquent the consequences can multiply. A person’s inability to pay fines arising from simple infractions can lead not only to mounting debt, but also to further court order s that can impact 
opportunities for housing. 
 By July 2024, all trial courts will offer ability -to-pay determinations 
using the online “MyCitations” tool.  The tool will also allow low -
income court users to request a payment plan, more time to pay, or community service for an eligible 
infraction.  
 
 Action Areas and Recommendations  
34 initiatives to bring the internet to  remote areas and to increase access to free public internet 
service.  
Some judicial officers have expressed a view that collaborative courts should not be conducted 
remotely because success in those programs requires a relationship and personal rapport between the judge and the court user, which  can be difficult to establish through remote technology. 
However, other judicial officers report they have been able to establish the  necessary rapport 
through remote proceedings and that remote services have been particularly effective in eliminating the access barriers described in this report. M any court users have expressed 
appreciation for remote appearance options.  
The w ork group recommends that remote services be available as an option for courts and court 
users. Consistent with this recommendation, the Chief Justice’s Ad Hoc Workgroup on Post -
Pandemic Initiatives issued a first interim report recommending that California exp and and 
maximize remote access on a permanent basis for most court proceedings, and that the Judicial Council encourage and support courts in substantially expanding remote access while adopting policies that ensure consistency and fairness statewide with the flexibility to meet local needs. The Judicial Council should monitor concerns raised about remote services and work through internal and external channels —including consider ing legislative changes and changes to 
branchwide processes—to develop solutions for making remote services an option across case types.  
The Judicial Council Technology Committee and the Information Technology Advisory Committee, in coordination with other advisory committees, are positioned to oversee implementation of this recommen dation. 
Recommendation 3.2. Improve the availability of information about court services 
that address homelessness and housing issues by updating court websites to 
provide user -friendly and current information;  and help court users electronically 
connect t o the court, charge mobile devices, and receive email and text 
communicat ions from  the court.  
Court users experiencing or at risk of experiencing homelessness may have difficulty obtaining 
information about relevant court programs and services or communica ting with the court about 
their circumstances or their case. As essential sources of court -based information, court websites 
offer a significant avenue for ensuring that these court users have equal access to important information regarding available court  services and programs. The availability of text and email 
court reminders and charging stations for mobile devices also enables  the courts to improve court 
access, engagement, and communication.  
To assist the judicial branch in improving access and communication with court users, the Work Group on Homelessness recommends  the following : 
1. The Judicial Council should work with trial courts to create standard, user -friendly 
language and content  for court websites.  Action Areas and Recommendations  
35 2. The Judicial Council should continue to develop its self -service portal to target services 
for self- represented litigants and to provide court information on key issues and questions 
related to housing and homelessness.  
3. Each court website should provide information about available court servic es and 
community resources that address urgent housing and related needs.  
4. Courts should arrange to make mobile device charging stations available for court users.  
5. Courts should implement options for court users to receive court emails and text 
commun ications that provide  reminders and other information.  
Background  
Courts  offer a variety of services for users experiencing or at risk of experiencing homelessness, 
and some courts also have access to information about other community resources. Court 
websites are often the starting point for court users to le arn about court services and can also be a 
portal to broader community programs. In addition, many courts have been using other technologies to 
improve information and customer service for court 
users.  
Rationale for t he Recommendation  
In surveying the webs ites of courts known to 
provide housing or homelessness programs, the Work Group on Homelessness found wide variances 
in the availability and accessibility of relevant information. Some websites feature links to pages or items , in portable document format (PDF) , that 
describe the goals, eligibility criteria, and processes of their homeless court s and collaborative court 
programs and provide relevant contact information. Some websites, however, make no mention of their homeless court s and collaborative court programs, 
whereas others list such programs but provide minimal information about them. Some websites post outdated or incomplete information, or inoperable links to information.  
Court  websites currently do a better job in providing 
information about self -help centers and assistance to self -represented litigants, but websites vary 
in how a perso n can access such information. Some websites feature “Self -Help” tabs on the 
home pages ; others store self -help information under a “Services and Programs” tab or an “Info 
Centers” tab that connects users either to court webpages containing information for  self-
represented litigants  or to  the California Courts website for self -represented litigants . Providing Members of the Superior Court of Santa 
Clara County ha ve arranged to connect 
court users  who lack housing with cell 
phones . Time -certain calendaring and a 
cell phone charging station have also been made available. Through a justice partner, external cell phone batteries  
have been provided. The c ounty has 
provided  cell phones to persons  released  
from jail, and the court has se nt 
reminders and information to the se 
individuals through those phones . For 
young adults without housing and on the 
deferred entry of judgment calendar, the court distributes donated Chromebooks that allow the young adults to appear 
remotely and complete s choolwork.
 Action Areas and Recommendations  
36 easily accessible court information is important because of the  great demand for it: 
approximately 4 million California residents  connect to the judic ial branch self -help website each 
year.  
Many courts are beginning to us e the 2021 Judicial Council court website template, which was 
designed to be a cost -efficient way for courts to provide consistent, easy -to-access, and basic 
information regarding court  services and programs. The  template includes access to the judicial 
branch self -service portal and new branchwide digital services, including the virtual customer 
service center, online forms, and multilingual services.  Currently, 20 courts have successfu lly 
migrated to the new template and 12 additional court s are in progress and will be live by the end 
of FY 2021–22. 
Keeping information about court services consistent and current across court websites is essential 
to meeting public needs, avoiding unnece ssary confusion, and maintaining public confidence in 
the courts. When court websites provide information that is up to  date, easy to understand, and 
readily accessible, people can obtain the information they need without having to call or visit the court. Additionally, reducing the need for court staff to respond to public requests for basic court information will allow staff to focus on other responsibilities  and increase overall court 
efficiency and productivity.  
Court users without housing must also overcome various obstacles in seeking to establish a 
remote connection  with the court .
164 The work group heard reports that c ourt users who are 
experiencing homel essness may need time in the  morning to locate a computer or, if they have 
their own mobile device, an available electrical outlet to charge the device before they are able to use it for court communication or access. Courts can improve access by arranging  for a place at 
the courthouse or at the location of a justice partner or local provider for a court user to access a 
computer or to charge a mobile device . Courts can also help by allowing court users sufficient 
charging time before requiring an appearanc e or communication. 
In addition, c ourts can better assist people experiencing homelessness  in tracking upcoming 
court deadlines and other important court dates. Even when such individuals  have access to post  
office boxes or support systems through which they can obtain mail, the ir circumstances make 
keep ing track of deadlines or scheduled court appearances difficult, which can result in missed 
court dates with spiraling consequences, such as the loss of child custody or visitation or the issuance of a bench  warrant. Sending court users reminders and other information by email or 
text can improve outcomes . 
Costs to Implement  
Use of the 2021 Judicial Council court website template is cost -efficient for courts, and funding 
for the implementation of the template  is provided as part of the Judicial Council’s FY 2020–21 
State Trial Court Improvement and Modernization Fund program. This modernization funding is only for two fiscal years, through FY 2021–22. The Judicial Council is seeking information 
technology modernization funding for FY 2022–23 and ongoing. If allocated, this funding could 
provide stable resources for website maintenance and support. Alternatively, courts that want the Action Areas and Recommendations  
37 autonomy of maintaining their own websites would use  their court operations budget for 
immediate and ongoing website maintenance. Similarly, those courts would finance any website 
posting of information specific to a trial court and its local community from their court 
operations budget.  
The Judicial Council has been w orking on a statewide text and email reminder project 
compatible with all court case management systems. This statewide system would be cost -
efficient for courts. If courts desire to establish their own system for email and text communication and reminders , however, they would assume the costs for developing and 
maintaining those systems.
165 
The fiscal impact would be minimal in allowing court users to charge mobile devices by connecting to a court’s existing electrical outlet, or in arranging with justice partners and service providers to offer charging opportunities. Courts might consider arranging for wireless or wired charging tables , or charging lockers, which can charge and protect mobile devices. These 
arrangements would carry initial costs to the cour ts for the purchase of equipment and may carry 
ongoing maintenance costs. Planning for new court construction projects should include consideration of charging lockers and stations for court users.  
Opportunities and Considerations for Implementation  
To mea ningfully assist court users, courts offering court -based services and programs that focus 
on homelessness or housing instability should post relevant, user -friendly, and current 
information on their websites. Additionally, all courts should post informati on regarding local 
community resources for vulnerable populations. The Judicial Council should work with the courts to identify basic information that would be helpful for court users experiencing homelessness and for those who seek to assist them. The Jud icial Council should also continue 
developing its self -service portal to target services for self -represented litigants, and provide 
information on key issues and questions, including information on unlawful detainer  
proceedings , homeless court  and collaborative court programs, and other court services. 
All 58 counties manage their court website s in a largely independent manner. This independent 
management promotes trial court autonomy in website content but stands as the most significant barrier to making court websites consistent and user -friendly across counties. To promote greater 
consistency in website information provided by the judicial branch, the Judicial Council Information Technology Advisory Committee should work with courts to create standard website language and services for providing general information, and to determine the best 
processes for regular review and upkeep.  
Courts that can provide charging stations or easily accessible electrical outlets should make th ese 
tools available to court u sers. And c ollaborat ion with local entities  and individuals —such as 
libraries, attorneys, justice partners, and service providers —could assist  court users in  charg ing 
their mobile devices  and connecting remotely to the court .
166 Action Areas and Recommendations  
38 Research has been inconclusive regarding whether text and email reminders reduce failures to 
appear  in all case types.167 It stands to reason, however, that such improved communication has 
the potential to help. Staf f to the Judicial Council Information Technology Advisory Committee 
are working with the Superior Court of Los Angeles County to develop a branchwide notification system that includes text and email messages and notifications. During the pilot phase, the 
committee will select a handful of courts to test and refine the service. The committee anticipates  
that a future phase will include additional courts.  
The Judicial Council Technology Committee and the Information Technology Advisory Committee, in coordinat ion with other advisory committees, are well positioned to oversee 
implementation of this recommendation.  
Action Area 4: Strengthen education, outreach, and civic 
engagement on issues pertaining to homelessness . 
The California State Auditor noted that one of the problems in addressing homelessness is that responsibility to address the crisis is disjointed.
168 Echoing a similar sentiment, the National 
Center for State Courts urged judges to move away from “silos” and to seek collaborative solutions.
169 “Organi zations should understand that no specific entity oversee s comprehensive 
services and continuity of care for individuals. In fact, many individuals use several services simultaneously, underscoring the need to coordinate responses.”
170 To overcome 
compartmentalization, obtain ing the involvement and support of leaders across systems  is 
essential ,171 and a champion such as a judge can convene stakeholders, overcome barriers, and 
maintain a sustained level of commitment.172 
Court leaders and  judicial officers share such a commitment , and the Judicial Council employs 
various  processes t hat allow the judicial branch to work collaboratively and in partnership with 
the executive and legislative branches and other entities and stakeholders in effort s to pursue 
helpful programs  and effectuate efficiencies and cost savings.  
In addition to such civic engagement, judicial branch personnel should also work toward a broader understanding of homelessness and its impact on those experiencing it.  The judicial 
branch is committed to excellence in public service and recognizes the role that ongoing professional development, education, and training play in achieving the goals of the branch. Education is necessary to ensure that all actions of the branch and of the courts result in the fair 
and efficien t administration of justice and the reduction of  barriers to court access.  
Recommendation 4.1. Educate judicial officers and judicial branch personnel  
on issues relating to homelessness.  
Providing education on topics relating to homelessness will assist the judicial branch in reducing barriers to court access and can result in an increasingly fair and equitable justice system.  Action Areas and Recommendations  
39 To improve judicial branch education about homelessness, the Work Group on Homelessness 
recommends  the following : 
1. The Judicial Council should expand education al opportunities and encourage  judicial 
officers and judicial branch personnel to attend programs  relating to homelessness.  
2. The Judicial Council and its Center for Judicial Edu cation and Research (CJER) should 
collaborate with other education providers to ensure that training and educational 
opportunities are regularly available to judicial officers, judicial branch personnel, justice partners, and other stakeholders.  
Background  
The California Rules of Court state  the minimum education requirements and expectations for 
members of the judicial branch, including judicial officers and court staff.
173 Education 
requirements vary depending on branch position and assignment, and every m ember of the 
branch must  participate.  
Rationale for t he Recommendation  
Providing education on topics relevant to homelessness can reduc e misconceptions and biases 
involving court users who lack stable housing and can lead to a more empathetic approach in 
serving these court users, ultimately resulting in a more accessible, effective, equitable, and 
compassionate justice system . The work group identified the following topics that could be 
developed into educational curr icula: 
• Preferred definitions and terminology pertaining to homelessness  
• Causes of homelessness and shelter insecurity ( see the Executive Summary of th is report)  
• Barriers experienced by people without housing in accessing court programs and services 
(see th e Executive Summary and Action Area s 2 and 3 of this  report)  
• Techniques for alternative dispute resolution in unlawful detainer and small claims 
proceedings  
• Considerations in preparing long- range plans for housing security for youth and 
nonminor dependents  involved in the foster care system (s ee Recommendation 2.3 of this 
report)  
• Ways to avoid implicit bias174 based on homelessness or related circumstances such as 
income level, housing status, race, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, 
medical or mental health condition, substance use, veteran status, or prior traumatic experience  
Education and training on the foregoing topics  could increase awareness of the unique needs of 
individuals who are without housing or are housing insecure  and prompt  changes that reduce 
barriers to court access and improve housing stability. Training and educational opportunities 
that incorporate the lived experiences of individuals currently or formerly unhoused could be particularly impactful and should be developed.  Action Areas and Recommendations  
40 Costs to Implement  
The work group anticipates that c osts to the Judicial Council for providing education on topics 
related to homelessness would align with the ordinary costs for developing and updating 
education and training programs.  
Training could also be developed in collaboration with other educational providers, such as the 
California Judges Association, the State Bar of California, the California Lawyers Association, 
and private education providers. Those providers could help leverage existing funding sources to 
provide training. 
Opportunities and Considerations for Implementation  
The CJER Advisory Committee175 should make recommendations on enhancing curricula and 
instructional designs to specifically address issues related to homelessness.176 
Training  on topics related to homelessness can be incorporated into the  B. E. Witkin Judicial 
College or  New Judge Orientation curriculum, which require s the completion of three programs 
within two years after judicial officers take their oath of office.177 Previous education trainings at 
the B.  E. Witkin Judicial College  have included visits to San Quentin State Prison and the 
residential treatment program at the Delancey Street Foundation. These experien tial trainings 
play an important role in helping judicial officers develop empathy and understanding and 
improve  their ability to effectively engage with individuals in their court proceedings. Education 
on implicit bias in the homelessness context could a lso be provided to experienced judicial 
officers  as part of regular qualifying ethics and continuing education programs.  
Other educational and training events, such as the Judicial Council’s Beyond the Bench conference or the California Association of Coll aborative Courts conference, may provide 
further educational opportunities in this area.  
Recommendation 4.2. Engage with other public and private entities and 
individuals to enhance programs and services for people without housing or at 
risk of losing housing.  
The courts and the judicial branch should continue to engage  with other public and private 
entities and individuals to enhance programs and services for people experiencing or at risk of 
experiencing homelessness.  
As part of such engagement, the Work Group on Homelessness recommends  that courts  and the 
judicial branch consider : 
1. Serving as conveners  to bring members of the community together in addressing 
homelessness;  
2. Supporting legislation that seeks to improve court access  and overall legal and  other 
related outcomes for court users experiencing or at risk of experiencing homelessness, as well as legislation that addresses homelessness ; Action Areas and Recommendations  
41 3. Working to increase efficiencies in cases that would enhance homelessness prevention or 
where homelessness is at issue or at risk ; 
4. Collaborating with the other branches of government and local justice partners and community -based service providers to improve court responses to homelessness and to 
improve the  courts’ ability to assist court users in accessing housing and treatment 
services;  
5. Using  certain unused judicial branch properties for homelessness services ; and  
6. Arranging for individuals who have experienced homelessness to help improve court access and services.  
Background  
Led by t he Chie f Justice and the Judicial Council , the judicial branch has an organizational 
structure and process in place t o facilitate working  with the other branches of government and 
other entities and stakeholders to pursue helpful statewide programs  and effectuate  efficiencies 
and cost savings . As part of that structure, the c ouncil’s Legislation Committee and  Government al 
Affairs staff maintain regular lines of communication with other governmental leaders.  
Moreover, a s recently as January 2020, t he Judicial Counc il’s Homeless and Community Court 
Blueprint  urged courts to perform outreach to, and collaborate with , justice partners and other 
key players to ensure that people who are experiencing or at risk of experiencing homelessness  
“get critical services includin g housing eligibility screenings, case management, assistance with 
securing identification documents, medical and psychiatric evaluations, legal services, or 
assistance with applications for benefits or housing.”
178 
Rationale for t he Recommendation  
In creat ing the Work Group on Homelessness, the Chief Justice asked the work group to 
consider, among other things, how the judicial branch might work with the Governor, the Legislature, and other entities and stakeholders in addressing homelessness.
179 The Chief Justice 
also asked the work group to assess whether changes in laws, regulations , and rules might be 
necessary or helpful in responding to the homelessness crisis, and to evaluate whether judicial branch property and resources might be used  to advance homelessness assistance.  
One way that courts can bring community leaders together is by serving as a convener . The idea 
of judicial officers and courts serving as conveners  is not new, and a s long as it is done in an 
appropriate manner consistent wi th the role of the judicial branch and the California Code of 
Judicial Ethics,
180 there can be substantial benefits in calling  leaders together and engaging with 
other public and private entities and stakeholders181 to enhance programs and services for peopl e 
experiencing or at risk of experiencing homelessness . 
Another way the judicial branch can encourage helpful programs and services addressing homelessness is to support beneficial legislation. In this regard, the Judicial Council ’s Action Areas and Recommendations  
42 Legislation Committee and its Government al Affairs staff will continue to monitor and consider 
proposals and pending matters and maintain communication with government leaders.  In 
addition, the judicial branch should understand its purview to encompass pr oposals that are 
consistent with the s trategic plan  for California’s j udicial b ranch . 
As indicated, the judicial branch and the courts should also c ollaborat e with the other branches of 
government and local justice partners and community -based service providers to improve court 
responses to homelessness, and to improve the courts’ ability to assist court users in accessing 
housing and treatment services. Such collaboration is consistent with executive branch efforts to improve co mmunication and information sharing, such as the work on the data integration 
system being developed by the Homeless Coordinating and Financing Council.  
The work group also received information on delays in building affordable housing. Delays in court proc eedings can have an adverse impact on the provision of homelessness programs and 
services, including efforts to provide needed housing. Court leaders and judicial officers c are 
deeply about minimizing case delay and work tirelessly to afford court users quality dispositions in a fair and timely manner. A ll stakeholders must work together to develop fair, reasonable, and 
practical ways to increase case efficiencies that take into consideration  the totality of the 
circumstances.  
In addition, work group members spoke  with experts from the Judicial Council Facilities 
Services and Legal Services offices regarding the potential for repurposing unused or other 
available court properties . Work group members compared the details and locations of the 
unused properties  with the availability of nearby homelessness services and  identified for branch 
experts the locations of properties that might be suitable for use in providing homelessness 
services.  
Courts might also arrange for people who have previously experienced hom elessness or are 
currently housing insecure  to help the courts increase access, improve conditions in courthouse 
neighborhoods, and provide the assistance and services needed to address the crisis of homelessness.  Urban Alchemy, for example , is a nonprofit work development organization based 
in the City of San Francisco’s Tenderloin neighborhood, one of the highest crime areas in the city and home to the Superior Court of San Francis co County’s Civil Courthouse and 
Community Justice Center ; the Supreme Court of California ; the Judicial Council of California ; 
San Francisco City Hall ; University of California, Hastings College of Law ; and other legislative 
and executive branch agency offices, as well as a large number of people experiencing home lessness. Through a unique partnership with local government agencies, Urban Alchemy 
employs “practitioners,” many of whom were formerly incarcerated, to traverse the Tenderloin neighborhood daily and to provide a variety of services. They walk the streets  and the perimeter 
of the neighborhood in teams and work to redirect behavior that can negatively affect  the 
community, such as drug use and public urination and defecation. Practitioners are trained to assist people who are having mental health crises, can refer people to homeless outreach teams and other services, and carry Naloxone (commonly referred to as Narcan), an emergency medication used to combat the effects of opioid overdose. Urban Alchemy works on similar Action Areas and Recommendations  
43 projects  in the City of Los Angeles , and although it has  current representation in  only two cities, 
its model is effective  and could be replicated in any area.  
Costs to Implement  
The recommended types  of engagement —serving as a convener , supporting legislation, or 
collaborating with the other branches of government and stakeholders —are not anticipated to 
significantly impact court or Judicial Council  resources. A s the Coalition for Juvenile Justice 
explained, the use of collaborative convening “to solve problems and change policy or practice is 
an attractive option, because it can be done well even with minimal resources, apart from time.”
182 The judicial branch could use existing funding to engage with other public and private 
entities and individuals if costs arise.  
According to staff of the Judicial Council Facilities Services and Legal Services offices , 
considering the use of some court properties for homelessness services could provide cost savings to the judicial branch, depending on the arrangements. 
There may be costs to establish working r elationships with Urban Alchemy- type programs or 
with people who have previously experienced homelessness, but such arrangements have the 
potential to result in cost savings and other benefits over time.  
Opportunities and Considerations for Implementation  
Supporting executive and legislative branch efforts to reduce homelessness and ensure equal 
access to justice for all is critically important. A nd as courts consider how to improve access, 
enhance health and safety, and provide programs and services, they should consider partnering 
with local advocates and service providers to develop programs similar to the Urban Alchemy model. In that way , courts could make use of  the understanding and experience of people  who 
have lived without housing and have first -hand knowledge of its challenges. Such a program 
could be a win- win for all concerned.  
The purview of the Judicial Council and its internal committees and advisory bodies should be understood to permit review of pe nding legislation pertaining to homelessness services. 
Specifically , it may be  appropriate to take positions  on pending legislation involving issues that 
are central to the council ’s mission and goals , as stated in the Strategic Plan for California’s 
Judic ial Branch, as well as issues that affect  the administration of justice. As this report indicates , 
homelessness involves the following issues central  to the judicial branch s trategic plan:
183 
• Access, F airness, and Diversity: California’s courts will treat everyone in a fair and just 
manner, and all persons will have equal access to the courts.  
• Modernization of M anagement and Administration: J ustice will be administered in a fair, 
timely, efficient, and effective manner that implements innovative ideas . 
• Quality of J ustice and S ervice to the P ublic: T he judicial branch will work with branch 
constituencies to better ascertain court user’s needs and priorities, engage in community 
outreach, and implement processes that are fair and understandable.  Action Areas and Recommendations  
44 • Education for Branchwide P rofessional E xcellence: J udicial branch personnel will have 
access to the resources and training necessary to meet the diverse needs of the public and 
to enhance trust and confidence in the courts . 
• Branchwide Infrastructure for S ervice E xcellence: T he judicial branch will provide an 
administrative, technological, and physical infrastructure that supports and meets the 
needs of the public, the branch, and its justice system and community partners . 
• Adequate, S table, and Predictable F unding f or a Fully F unctioning B ranch: T he judicial 
branch will advocate for investment in the justice system to preserve access to justice for all Californians.  
Review of pending legislation addressing homelessness is consistent with the foregoing s trategic 
plan goals  and should be understood as within the proper purview of the  Judicial Council and its 
internal committees and advisory bodies . 
This recommendation is suitable for consideration by various Judicial Council internal and 
advisory committees and offices , including, but not limited to, the Executive and Planning 
Committee  and the Legislation Committee ; the Administrative Presiding Justices, Trial Court 
Presiding Judges, Court Executives, Court Facilities, Probate and Mental Health, Trial Court 
Facility  Modification, Criminal Law, Court Security, Appellate, and Collaborative Justice Courts 
Advisory Committee s; the Advisory Committee on Providing Access and Fairness ; and the 
Governmental Affairs, Legal Services, and Facilities Services  offices . 
  
45 Conclusion  
Approximately 12.5 percent of U.S.  residents live in California , and yet it is home to 27 percent 
of the nation’s population without permanent housing.184 On any given day, 150,000 California 
residents will experience homelessness.185 The COVID -19 pandemic has exacerbated the 
situation , with  nearly one  in five  households lack ing confidence in their ability to pay their next 
month’s rent .186 These statistics confirm  the need for further action from government at the 
federal, state , and local levels.  
In appointing this work group, Chief Justice Cantil -Sakauye reaffirmed that all Californians  are 
entitled to equal access to the courts  regardless of their housing circumstances, and that all court 
users deserve dignity and justice. Courts are also in a position to assist individuals without 
housing and improve outcomes.  The recommendations in this report are consistent with the 
Chief Justice’s vision and can help t o significantly reduce the crisis of homelessness in 
California.  
  
46 Appendix : Topics for Possible  Future Consideration  
In the course of the work group’s research and interviews, ideas surfaced that are not discussed 
in the report for various reasons, such as that the ideas were deemed to require study beyond the 
limited duration of the Work Group on Homelessness. Nevertheless, some of the ideas are referenced below , in no particular order , for possible future consideration: 
• Amending the conservatorship laws . 
• Establishing a Penal Code section 858 advisement of housing resources . 
• Using criminal diversion statutes more effectively.  
• Extending the time to respond in unlawful detainer proceedings . 
• Discontinuing use of the VI -SPDAT ( Vulnerability Index —Service Prioritization 
Decision Assistance Tool)  as an assessment tool to determine risk and prioritization for 
housing because of criticisms that the index is unreliable and potentially racially biased . 
• Screening for adverse childhood experiences . 
• Connecting with the Homeless Coordinating and Financing Council’s data integration 
project . 
• Further reviewing custody release and medical discharge planning.  
• Further expanding fee waivers and ability -to-pay provisions . 
• Amending the requirements for service of process on individual s without housing.  
• Amending laws providing for driver’s license suspension  if a person falls behind on child 
support . 
• Reducing attorney professional fees to encourage pro bono or other public legal service . 
• Providing notice to counties when unlawful detainer complaints are filed  or pending so 
that they are aware of potential evictions . 
• Enacting a permanent rental assistance program . 
• Eliminating laws and rules that punish or impose fines for acts of living in vehicles or 
public spaces. 
• Working with local justice system partners to ensure that individuals who are unhoused 
are not unduly affected  by arrests and charges for quality -of-life crimes that are a result 
of their housing status.  
• Addressing systemic and structural disparities . 
• Creating a cause of action to enforce responses in addressing homelessness. 
• Redirecting savings from prison closings to fund affordable housing.  
• Co-locating community -based services at courthouses.  
• Providing a housing solution as par t of the resolution of a court case . 
• Increasing the number of beds for individuals deemed incompetent to stand trial . 
• Increasing childcare  for people attending to  court  business . 
• Redefining homelessness as a public health crisis . 
• Establishing a right to sh elter.  
• Enacting an obligation to accept shelter when it is offered.  Appendix: Topics Worthy of Future Consideration  
47 • Further utilizing emergency powers .

that individuals reside in homeless encampments, as opposed to shelters, is related to the perceived dangerousness of 
homeless shelters. See Re becca Cohen, Will Yetvin, and Jill Khadduri,  Understanding Encampments  of People

purpose of the study.

74 Significant federal restrictions operate to bar undocumented immigrants from receiving Shriver assistance in some 
of the counties served.  Specifically, a majority of the nonprofits that serve as the lead legal services agencies in 
Shriver -funded programs —for example , Central California Legal Services, Greater Bakersfield Legal Assistance, 
Legal Aid Society of  San Diego, Legal Services of Northern California, and Neighborhood Legal Services of Los 
 End Notes

Angeles —receive a substantial portion of their overall funding from the federal Legal Services Corporation (LSC). 
See Legal Services Corporation, “Our Grantees ,” www.lsc.gov/grants/our -grantees  (as of Sept.  2, 2021).  Because 
the federal government generally prohibits LSC -funded nonprofits from receiving federal funding if they provide 
legal services to undocumented  immigrants, these nonprofits must forgo assisting immigrants to be able to serve 
other deserving individuals. See 45 C.F.R. § 1626 1 et seq. ; Act of Apr. 26, 1996 , Pub.L. No. 104-134, § 504(a)(11), 
110 Stat. 1321- 54, 1321 -55. These restrictions apply even if a nonprofit also receives funding from the Shriver 
program or other sources that are available to serve low -income clients and that do not have such restrictions. In 
other counties, the lead agency does not receive LSC fun ds and , thus, is able to serve undocumented immigrants. In 
Los Angeles, the program has  identified ways to subcontract for those services, but in other counties the Shriver 
program is largely unable to meet the legal needs of the vulnerable immigrant popul ation.  
75 2020 Shriver report, supra  note 4 3, at pp. 13, 51. To be eligible for Shriver counsel, litigants must have a 
household income of not more than 200  percent  of the federal poverty level (FPL). In 2019, FPL was $25,750 for a 
family of four. Grantees may also employ the asset limitation that they use for other eligibility.

77 Senate Bill 2160  (Stats. 2000,  ch. 450) amended Welfare and Institutions Code  section 317 to require (1)  the 
appointment of counsel for parents and children in nearly all dependency cases; (2) for appointed counsel caseloads 
and training that ensure adequate representation; and (3) Judicial Council promulgation of rules establishing 
caseload standards, training requirements, and guidelines for appointment of counsel for children. As part of this 
court- appointed counsel program, the Judicial Council adopted rule 5.660 of the California Rules  of Court, which  
requires each trial court to, in consultation with dependency system partners, adopt their  own local rules of court 
regarding representation of parties in dependency proceedings. The rule address es timelines and procedures in 
dependency cases, processes for identification and appointment of attorneys (including minimum qualifications), 
procedur es to determine appropriate caseload sizes, processes for resolving complaints, and other relevant 
procedures.  
78 Welf . & Inst. Code, §§ 317, 903.1, 903.47.  
79 Court- appointed dependency counsel became a state fiscal responsibility in 1989 through the  Brown -Presley Trial 
Court Funding Act (Sen. Bill 612/Assem. Bill 1197; Stats. 1988,  ch. 945).  This act added Government Code section 
77003, defined “court operations ” in that section  as including court- appointed dependency counsel, and made an 
appropriation to f und trial court operations.  In 1997,  the Lockyer -Isenberg  Trial  Court Funding  Act (Assem.  Bill 
233; Stats.1997,  ch. 850) provided the funding for, and delineated the parameters of, the transition to state   trial court 
funding that had been  outlined in the  earlier  legislation. An additional $10  million was added to the funding in fiscal 
year 2021– 22 to assist courts in recouping costs associated with the COVID -19 pandemic and its impact on the 
dependency counsel program.  
80 Title IV -E of the Social Security Act  (42 U.S.C. § 670 et seq.) enables states and counties to seek reimbursement 
from the federal government for eligible foster care –related expenditures , allow ing title IV -E match funds to be used 
for dependency counsel who provide legal representation to children in foster care and their parents. This funding 
has the potential to provide up to an additional $57 million to augment court -appointed counsel service s.

99 Since the passage of the COVID -19 Tenant Relief Act of 2020 (AB 3088; Stats. 2020, ch.  37, §  20) and follow up 
urgency legislation, the Judicial Council has approved the adoption and revision of certain unlawful detainer forms 
and information sheets to ens ure that new state and federal protections for tenants are reflected in the forms.  While 
these recent ly adopted forms and information sheets provide clarification in the context of the pandemic -related 
legislation , the work group’ s comments and recommendat ions are directed toward the standard elements of the 
unlawful detainer forms.

109 Staff to the Civil and Small Claims Advisory Committee indicate  that requiring inclusion of the date of service 
on unlawful detainer summons may necessitate a legislative amendment to Code of Civil Procedure sec tion 1167 or 
412.20. Under  section 1167, the unlawful detainer summons is supposed to be in the format set out in section 412.20 
(except with five days to respond), but the latter section does not require that the date of service be stated in the 
summons. By comparison, Code of Civil Procedure section 415.46, regarding prejudgment claims to right of 
possession, does require that the date of service be included for service of those forms.

160 Work Group on Homelessness, personal correspondence with a variety of homeless courts , including  those that 
are part of the Superior Courts of  Contra Costa, Humboldt, Santa Clara County , and Ventura  Counties . 
161 Interviews conducted by the Work Group on Homelessness confirmed that users who lack a personal internet 
connection or are unable to connect to a court video conference with their own mobile device have been able to 
connect through coll aborative arrangements with others . For example, in the Superior Court of Ventura County, 
court users have been able to connect to the homeless  court ’s Zoom proceeding in the courthouse library or at the 
Public Defender ’s Office. In the Superior Court of Santa Clara County, court users have been able to connect via 
their attorney s. The Superior Court of Placer County is working to provide remote access to the Homeless Court 
through a mobile video system brought into the community,  and the Superior Court of Orange County arrange d with 
the law library to make personal computers available for remote appearances by court users.  
162 Interviews conducted by the Work Group on Homelessness with a variety of homeless courts confirmed that 
some courts have had considerable success bringing in -person homeless court proceedings to a community location 
where the participants are located . For example, superior courts in the following counties have held proceedings at a 
community location:  Alameda, Contra Costa, Fresno, Ke rn, Los Angeles, Orange, Sacramento, San Bernardino, San 
Diego, San Joaquin, Santa Clara, Sonoma, and Ventura.  
163 Interviews conducted  by members of the Work Group on Homelessness with a variety of homeless courts  
confirmed courts are considering “mobile co urts” as a solution to travel to a location and help participants connect 
remotely to a court proceeding . For example, the Superior Court of Santa Clara County explored such a project and 
obtained willingness from Cisco Systems to wire a van at no cost, an d the Superior Court of Placer County and the 
Placer County Probation Department are developing a mobile court for homeless court participants.

165 For example, the Court Innovations Grant Program project expenditures surrounding text/email reminder systems 
ranged from $17,000 -  $160,000. Court costs for efforts to implement their own system would depend on the current 
technological infrastructure at the court, the amount of court staff resources required to implement the system, and 
whether the court purchases an “off the shelf” system . 
166 Interviews conducted by members of the Work Group on Homelessness with a variety of courts confirmed court 
collaboration with local partners and entities. For example, in the Superior Court of Ventura County, court users
